Barinholtz, who has worked with many homeless and under-privileged young adults, says that his inspiration comes from his experiences in helping these individuals return to a life off the streets by teaching them his woodworking skills.  He helped those who had previously “floated” through their days, “from couch to couch, door to door, shelter to abandoned building” and who had fallen into a lifestyle of drugs, violence, and other crimes. He said that “Saint Elizabeth’s physical transformation is akin to the achievements I have witnessed in my students-to move beyond a legacy of perceived disconnection from the community, on the ‘other side of the river.’”  The boats represent this connection to the community, this time for the patients of St. Elizabeth’s.",

        description: " LeDroit Park is a small neighborhood filled with unique architectural character and historical significance to the African American community located south of Howard University in northwest Washington, D.C. In the first half of the 20th century, the LeDroit Park area was a center of African American intellectual and cultural life.  Robert A. Terrell, the first African American municipal Judge and his wife, Mary Church Terrell, an educator, suffragette, and civil rights activist, were examples of the prominent African Americans who lived in LeDroit Park. In 2007, the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities collaborated with LeDroit Park residents in a public art project that sought to express the character and history of the neighborhood. Artist Garin Baker was selected to create a mural, which was completed in 2008 and titled “This Is How We Live.” The mural ties in the historical context of the neighborhood while enforcing a positive message.  According to Mayor Adrian Fenty, “This initiative will visually engage residents through a beautiful neighborhood mural that depicts the unique landscapes, people and images of the historic LeDroit Park community. The mural will become a prominent landmark in the neighborhood for years to come.”",

His main entrance lobby painting shows St. Elizabeth’s as it was in the early 20th century , with emphasis on the park-like setting. His reason for this was that “the imagery will turn the mind to thoughts of nature, the beauty of which provides both solace and hope.” His work also represents the de-stigmatization of mental health patients and the compassion that the community is starting to show in regards to their healing process.  Gibbons stated that “the quality…will carry a message- it will tell the patients that someone cared enough about them to do some really good work.”",

Crawford to create what became known as “The Dragon Gate,” which originates from the image of a dragon.  In the Chinese culture, the dragon is considered a symbol of greatness, prosperity, and good fortune.  The gate also represents the Chinese 12-year cycle through its twelve pickets, and the subtle row of rivets represent the Chinese American contribution to the American Transcontinental Railroad.   ",

The desired outcome is to stimulate conversation about how art can be made and exhibited; to change the dialogue between artist and gallery owner; and to create a new market for art not typically found in the commercial art spaces in Washington, DC.",

Mellon. During the 1920s, Mr. Mellon began collecting with the intention of forming a gallery of art for the nation in Washington. In 1937, the year of his death, he promised his collection to the United States. Funds for the construction of the West Building were provided by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust. On March 17, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted the completed building and the collections on behalf of the people of the United States of America.\n\nMore information at http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm\n",

However, independent curator and art historian Leah Levy, who served as the public art advisor for the project, said the thematic connections between the sculpture and bio-tech company were purely coincidental. \n\n“\&#x27;I\&#x27;m Alive’ has as its backdrop Mission Bay, so someone said it looked like a wave,\&quot; Levy said. \&quot;There are a lot of options for understanding the piece.\&quot;",

The mosaic is meant to depict, according to Jackson-Jarvis, “the topographical meandering course of the Anacostia River.” The mural “pays homage to the resilient and forceful nature of the river to regenerate itself and marks our on going struggle to live in harmony with the treasures of our natural resources.” Also noteworthy is the fact that the mural features images inspired by the Nacotchtanke, the Native American tribe that once lived along the river. The images include a tortoise, which represented the spirit guide of the river, as well as a stylized image of a “Wampum” a symbol of Native American trade. River Spirits of the Anacostia, completed in 2004, is part of the DCCAH-commissioned Art in Transit project, which seeks to instill a more visual appeal into the metro stations across D.C. This mural in particular is unique because it captures the Native American history of the area and takes a stand on preserving our ecological surroundings. ",

Stepping through the doorway, one might find a shadowy cavern draped with shapes resembling entrails; stark photographs of the homeless ironically juxtaposed with scenes from fast food restaurants; carefully detailed shrines peopled with dogs impersonating saints; tall, elegant glass vessels filled with milk; or even a quiet group of small paintings mingling symbols, patterns and color. \n...\nFounded in 1974, it is one of Washington\&#x27;s oldest surviving artist owned spaces, with half of its exhibitions devoted to the work of nonmembers. Something in the mix of continuity of members\&#x27; shows and the unexpected contributions of guest artists generates a lively energy that keeps the atmosphere of risk and dedication to art alive and well. \n\nRead more: http://www.gallery10dc.com/about.asp",

This reflects the North Lincoln Park neighborhood, which is also striving, growing, and working together to find a balance in the needs of its community.  According to Billig, “balance, as demonstrated by these two children in the sculpture, calls for faith and confidence in one another.” As the sculpture is located across the street from Maury Elementary, she hopes it will convey a positive message to the neighborhood’s youth and inspire them to depend on openness and to help those around them.",

Jann Rosen-Queralt was responsible for the design of the metro and fountain plaza areas, and other artists, selected and trained by Rosen-Queralt, created mosaic medallions along 14th street.  The design is based on kaleidoscope, a sign for celebrating the diversity of the community, and features themes from different locales (Africa, Latin America, North America and South East Asia).  The design of the plaza accommodates community events and truly contributes to a more public-friendly area.",

CentroNia applied to the MuralsDC program in order to illustrate a proud affirmation of the identities and complex human narratives as a response to the forces of gentrification.

Images of an elderly couple dancing together reflect the joy of living, and an elderly man lifting a weight with a look of focused determination represents persisting vigor.

In Kravitz’s proposal, he stated that “my choice of the butterfly as a general idea for this work derives from my understanding of the word ‘psyche’…as a symbol of the soul or transformation.” He chose the butterfly, as well as the light, floating stained glass design, in order to instill a calming effect on the mind. He also notes the inspirational quote by R. Bach: “What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the rest of the world calls butterfly.”  In relation to this quote, Kravitz notes that “since a hospital setting is always premised on rebirth and restoration or body, I can’t think of a better way to approach this project. My hope is that the symmetrical aspect of these shapes enhance a viewer’s quest for balance and movement.”",

The mural, “Positive Actions,” uses the structure of music, rhythm, harmony, and melody to communicate its theme: common bonds of heritage, positive actions, and inspirational words for the future. Smith stated that although the mural reaches beyond sports activities, team sports such as basketball are one of the best tools this society uses to teach its youth the value of working in unity.  The mural, therefore, applauds the teamwork responsible for making the Fort Davis Recreation Center a positive community tool.  This project was the first of several that the DCCAH has commissioned over the years with the goal of revitalizing D.C.’s recreation facilities to create a more inviting and community-oriented environment.",

Smith worked with his students at Howard to execute the 4 X 160 foot mural, which is meant to liken the cityscape architecture to the bass or the rhythm section of a jazz ensemble.  The mural was installed at the U Street Cordoza Metro Stop in 1995. In regards to the intention of the mural, Smith stated the following: “The value of this mural is in the process. What Bearden envisioned was the sharing that musicians have.  Unlike dancers, visual artists have always worked by themselves.  Here, students have followed the call-and-response patterns of jazz—one artist does something and another responds.”",

        description: "After being installed in 1997, this Duke Ellington Mural (painted by Byron Peck) was taken down from its original U Street location because of new construction that obscured the mural completely. This was much to the dismay of many of the Shaw community residents, such as Howard University student Amanda Miller. In a Washington Post article, the 18 year old jazz aficionado expressed that “Duke’s familiar face helped me through my first years at Howard and gave me a sense of permanence through my many transitions...With Duke discarded to make room for a larger Metro stop, a sandwich shop, and a Starbucks, it seemed that gentrification was wiping away U Street’s character.  I mourned the death of my Duke and my street.” However, in April of 2004, it was enlarged and reinstalled on the adjacent building- the True Reformer Hall, which was the site of Ellington’s first concert.  Although it is no longer in its original space, the enlarged mural is easier for people to see now as it is higher up, and it covers a fading Coca-Cola logo. Many residents of the community are relieved that the mural, which represents the famous musical past of their neighborhood, was saved rather than being discarded into a forgotten pile.  ",

Originally situated on Varnum Street in Brentwood, MD, they were reinstalled here when the Quixote Center relocated in 2011. The sculptures are made from 1-inchthick steel plate and were hand fabricated using a number of welding and flame-cutting processes.\n\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to all of the volunteers who helped this past Saturday with the landscaping and to all whose donations have helped make the unveiling possible: Gateway CDC Board Members Marcus Adams, Laura Rogers, Nina Young, Tim Tunner, Sara Prigan and Jennifer Kravassi; Jeff Clark; Dolly Pomerlau; and the sculpture Dan Walsh. \n\nThanks to the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission for funding in 2011 for the installation of the sculptures.",

It is composed of 5 colorful independent 9ft horn instrument forms spaced so people can walk among them. A map of the County is embedded in the instruments. There are a series of “hand plates” that when touched illuminate and the instruments play a sound or group of sounds from a \&quot;sound bank\&quot; -- a combination of environmental, historical and melodic sounds significant to the County and its impact on the region. A County-specific riddle is engraved on a stainless steel plaque at the center of the sculpture. When the riddle is deciphered and \&quot;hand plates\&quot; are touched in the correct pattern, the instruments will play a saxophone \&quot;short\&quot; in reply. The sculpture is lit from dusk to dawn.",

This artistic presentation, depicting important moments in the history of the United States, is the first piece in a comprehensive exhibit about this great nation. Mr. Ratner\&#x27;s metal sculpture, 15 feet tall with 40 painted aluminum panels, tells the story of the individuals, the principles, and the events that helped shape America\&#x27;s founding and development.\n\nThe noted artist, Phillip Ratner, was commissioned by University Town Center to create new public art more about at for the emerging mixed use development. Mr. Ratner\&#x27;s studio is in Bethesda, Maryland. He has created art in many Washington area homes and institutions. He is particularly well known for his art at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, and at the Supreme Court in Washington, DC.\n\nThe signature art presentation for University Town Center consists of four units, each twelve feet high and five feet wide. The art is laser cut from aluminum, hand painted and mounted in an aluminum frame.\n\nRatner also has prepared replicas of eighteen historical documents portraying key aspects of the founding and growth of the United States. Each of the documents and brief descriptions are presented on 2\&#x27;x3\&#x27; free standing aluminum frames.\n\nThe signature art and the documents are exhibited in a newly landscaped area called Documents Garden, which is at the Metro 3 office building in the University Town Center development. Several archivists and historians at the National Archives volunteered to assist Mr. Ratner with his selections.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Ratner created eight larger-than-life terrapins, which were designed and painted by students in four Prince George\&#x27;s County schools with themes relating to American history. The terrapins were displayed on the plaza as a temporary installation as part of the University Town Center art project.",

New neon “Franklin’s” signage, windows, and paint also graces the brewpub’s façade thanks in part to a City of Hyattsville administered Community Development Block Grant. The placemaking mural will light up the night for north-bound travelers along Route 1. “We think it will make quite a splash, and a lasting impression for this stretch of the corridor,” observed Stuart Eisenberg, Executive Director of the Hyattsville Community Development Corporation (CDC). The Hyattsville CDC is also administering a Street Art Initiative along the Route 1 Corridor incorporating the entire Gateway Arts District and Riverdale Park.  “We can only hope that other property owners in the area strive to match Mike’s impressive contribution to the street and building-scape and to the Arts in Hyattsville and the Gateway Arts District.”  \n\nhttp://www.hyattsvillecdc.org/content/view/317/1/\n",

The bold, precise outlines give his ideas an immediate impact, but it\&#x27;s the aftertaste that really cuts deep. Everything comes with a story. I have never known Jeremy to create something without a reason for it to exist and an accompanying tale. His pictures are built from the simplest ingredients, ingredients with which the everyman can identify. Fish documents his every day, every trip, every friend, and every experience within his art to the point where one could line up his life\&#x27;s work, decode the riddles, and have a clear idea of where he\&#x27;s been, how he felt about it, the types of folk he chopped it up with, and what lies ahead.\n\nLearn more: http://www.sillypinkbunnies.com/",

This ongoing process, at times, transcends to an ethereal level wherein all else – the mundane, the routine of life – is put aside to experience a wondrous time of joy and fulfillment. This time of “oneness” with the painting, fleeting as it is, bonds me to picture making, and so too does the excitement of discovery during the painting process. The subject I paint serves only as a starting point, thus my work appears diverse, but color, light, brush work and structure are my true subjects.\&quot;\n\nLearn more: http://www.boiseopenstudios.com/john-killmaster-2/",

Quiroga, who also provided art workshops for children at Sherwood, said that this project was inspired by an activity at the center called “hand dancing,” which originated in D.C. in the 1950’s as a version of swing. The name comes from the fact that while dancing, the two partners’ hands are always joined in some way.  According to Quiroga, “the simple act of joining hands and reaching out to one another can lead to the building of bridges across all boundaries that exist within communities.”  Her mural portrays how Sherwood does exactly this; it unites community members.  This project is one of several commissioned by the DCCAH with the goal of revitalizing D.C.’s recreation facilities to create a more inviting and community-oriented environment.",

Melville’s colorful and vibrant stained glass design compliments the homey ambiance of the small building, which is integrated into a quiet neighborhood.  Melville suggested that the stained glass would add cheerful and energetic images which would reflect the varying interests and pursuits of the center’s members.  She stated that she “wanted these windows to joyfully humanize this very modern building.” This project is one of several commissioned by the DCCAH with the goal of revitalizing D.C.’s recreation facilities to create a more inviting and community-oriented environment.",

It celebrates the history of Route 66 and its influence on the Phoenix Avenue neighborhood and the larger community of Flagstaff. \n\nThe Mural Mice, R.E. Wall and Maggie Dewar, painted the mural over the course of five months between late May and October. The story-telling and artistic merit of the mural is obvious to motorists waiting to cross the train tracks across San Francisco Street but you’re doing yourself a disservice if you don\&#x27;t view it as a pedestrian and discover its rich detail and artistically integrated symbolism. As \&#x27;community muralists\&#x27;, the Mice spent considerable time organizing community involvement \&#x27;paint-ins\&#x27;, researching the \&#x27;Mother Road’ history at NAU\&#x27;s Cline Library and, interviewing representatives of local Indian tribes and long-time residents to make sure the imagery was appropriate to the telling of the story.\n\nThe mural is located on Phoenix Avenue which was part of the original alignment of Route 66 in downtown Flagstaff on the south wall of the Lumberyard Brewery.\n",

        description: "The Route 1 Ride Collaborative is happy and proud to issue the following press release announcing the winning bus wrap design. Please share with your colleagues and other circles.\n\nAxner - ZoomFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \nContact: Stuart Eisenberg\nCall for Artist Coordinator\n(301) 683-8267\neisenberg@hyattsvillecdc.org\n\nContact: Alex Hirtle\nRoute 1 Ride Collaborative Coordinator\n301-952-3170\najhirtle@co.pg.md.us\n\nOctober 23, 2012 — The Route 1 Ride Collaborative is pleased to announce its winning bus wrap design: Jennifer Axner’s “Route 1 Paint Tube”. The Collaborative chose to crowdsource the bus wrap design to increase ridership and awareness of the Route 1 Ride as a way to get around while enjoying the unique charms of visiting, living, working, and playing in the Route 1 Corridor. Three final designs were selected by a jury comprised of Route 1 Corridor County and Municipal representatives; Axner’s fellow finalists included Matthew Gifford and Boshwell Talavera. The final selection was conducted by an online vote on www.Route1Ride.com, conducted from late July 2012 until September 21st, 2012.\n\n\n\nAxner’s wrap design will be installed on TheBus: Route 17, serving Prince George’s County’s Route 1 Corridor communities from Mount Rainier to College Park; for a period of at least three years, beginning in late 2012. The project is generously sponsored by The Route 1 Ride Collaborative and its Municipal members in recognition of the critical role that the arts play in the revitalization of Prince George’s County and the lives of its residents.\n\n \n\nRoute 1 Ride is a collaboration of Prince Georges County’s Department of Public Works &amp; Transportation (DPW&amp;T) and the Route 1 Communities\n\nCouncilmember Mary A.

With a 12-foot high concave area underneath, the sculpture invites visitors to visually interact with its mirror-like surface. According to Kapoor, he wanted the piece to have a classical feel yet at the same time to be very contemporary.\n\nKapoor was selected by the Millennium Park Art Committee in 1999 following a competition of more than 20 contenders. The number was narrowed down to two and ultimately, Kapoor\&#x27;s design was considered the most innovative. The unique spirit and direction in Kapoor\&#x27;s vast body of work embraced the essence of the project and the spirit of the next millennium.\&quot;\n",

        description: "\&quot;The Lightning Field (1977), by the American sculptor Walter De Maria, is a work of Land Art situated in a remote area of the high desert of western New Mexico. It is comprised of 400 polished stainless steel poles installed in a grid array measuring one mile by one kilometer. The poles -- two inches in diameter and averaging 20 feet and 7½ inches in height -- are spaced 220 feet apart and have solid pointed tips that define a horizontal plane. A sculpture to be walked in as well as viewed, The Lightning Field is intended to be experienced over an extended period of time. A full experience of The Lightning Field does not depend upon the occurrence of lightning, and visitors are encouraged to spend as much time as possible in the field, especially during sunset and sunrise. In order to provide this opportunity, Dia offers overnight visits during the months of May through October. (Please note that the 2013 visiting season is July 1 through October 31. The Lightning Field is closed May 1 through June 30, 2013 for preventive maintenance. The reservations office will remain open.)\n\nCommissioned and maintained by Dia Art Foundation, The Lightning Field is recognized internationally as one of the late-twentieth century\&#x27;s most significant works of art and exemplifies Dia\&#x27;s commitment to the support of art projects whose nature and scale exceed the limits normally available within the traditional museum or gallery.\n\nDia also maintains two other of De Maria\&#x27;s projects, both located in New York City: The Broken Kilometer (1979) and The New York Earth Room (1977). \&quot;",

        description: "\&quot;Over the last five years a series of sculptures by British artist Andy Goldsworthy have appeared in various sites around the Presidio, the expansive former military base adjacent to the Golden Gate Bridge. Spire (2008) makes use of thirty-seven felled Monterey Cypress trees in an architectural formation reminiscent of great church spires. Wood Line (2008) repurposes eucalyptus branch trimmings sourced from various projects that required tree removal, including the recent reconstruction of the Golden Gate Bridge\&#x27;s southern approach, to create a winding sculpture on the Presidio\&#x27;s oldest foot path, known to many as Lover\&#x27;s Lane.\n\nEach project follows in the long tradition of Goldsworthy\&#x27;s work, which primarily repurposes natural elements to engender a greater consideration of both the natural and the built environment. His latest installation Tree Fall (2013) debuted last month. While it is an obvious continuation on earlier themes, its placement in the former Civil War-era Powder Magazine on the Main Post offers provocative new possibilities in considering how man-made conditions collide with nature.\n\nIt must first be said that this work is both very much in keeping with the artist\&#x27;s larger body of work and simultaneously radically different from past approaches. The Powder Magazine is a small, discreet building positioned on the far end of a large green belt surrounded by intersecting streets and parking lots, east of the Main Parade Ground. Its original function was to house gunpowder and munitions -- the walls are four-feet thick stone slabs, while the doomed ceiling was built to channel accidental explosions upwards to protect people and neighboring buildings. Tree Fall occupies this domed ceiling and the viewer is immediately positioned beneath the work upon entry, a literal allusion to the artist\&#x27;s ongoing inquiry about what goes on beneath the surface of things.\&quot;",

In these Rickey combined his love of engineering and mechanics, designing sculptures whose metal parts moved in response to the slightest air currents despite the fact that they were often very large, sometimes weighing tons. Rickey was inspired by David Smith\&#x27;s graceful, yet solid, cubic forms, and Alexander Calder’s mobiles.",

Students from 12 high schools created the mural depicting the history of the county and the community around each school.  Under the guidance of art teachers, 142 students spent close to 3 months painting the murals.  By reaching out to the students, “Gorgeous Prince George’s:  Then &amp; Now” created a greater appreciation for art and history within the community while providing attractive visuals for common area walls.

The talented Peck, who is frequently commissioned for D.C. public art projects, created “Three Macaws,” a mural which celebrates the diverse array of Latino, African-American, and Asian-American culture which makes up the Adams Morgan community. It depicts three parrots, all native to Central and South America, Africa, and Asia.  Other images, such as an Asian dragon and African warriors, are also depicted. The Mexican deity signifying renewal and rebirth is said to perhaps be an allusion to community healing after ethnically charged riots in the neighborhood two years earlier.",

        description: "This mural is dedicated to Leroy Looper and “his belief in neighborhood people working to make San Francisco more beautiful.” \n\nIts title was inspired by the Marvin Gaye song, and its subject matter depicts the rich history and recent transformations of the Bayview neighborhood. \n\n\&quot;The mural depicts these changes chronologically from the right to the left... Beginning on the right side we see images of a not too distant past. The stream depicted is the Islais Creek, as it would have looked like before it was buried under the city. The grazing horses are remembered by several of the senior residents in the neighborhood. \n\nIn the center of the mural we see a movement towards our present day landscape. The automobile replaces the horse and the natural landscape is being carves up to build roads and urban dwellings. As the scene progresses we see Bayview as it is today. Multicultural symbols have been places on buildings to display the diversity that is found in the neighborhood. Ultimately the urban setting blends back into the natural environment. The mural ends in a cluster of Redwood trees showing the cyclical nature of life.\&quot;\n\nThe young man near the center of the mural was based off a Revere Street resident who assisted in the mural\&#x27;s creation. He represents the local young people who question and reflect on \&quot;what\&#x27;s going on\&quot; in their community.\n\nThis mural was created in partnership with the Revere Neighbors, SF Clean City, the Precita Eyes Muralists, and funded by the SF Challenge Grant Program.",

Sometimes this is a passive action, other times it can lead to a dramatic change as chaos unfolds in the generative algorithms. The choreography of this mathematical world forms a continuous cyclic narrative of creation, depression, agency, and rebirth. Each moment is unique, echoed but never repeated.",

It was one of two murals that didn\&#x27;t use aerosol painting techniques; rather, the artists used a German mineral paint that looks like liquid glass and is designed to last 100 years. This mural combines history with modernity, as oval portraits of Langston Hughes and Carter Woodson are placed amidst scenes of the block\&#x27;s renovation. Robert E. Bates, a member of the church, commented that “there is one major flaw with the mural-it is on the side of the building.  I regret it is not in a more prominent location so thousands can see it. I love it.” The positive reactions from community members, such as this one, reflect the success of Murals DC and the potential that these murals have to light up a community.",

        description: "In 2003, local artist Anne Allardyce designed and created a sculpture for the Congress Heights Metro Station titled “East of the River: Connections.”  In the past, Congress Heights has been described as one of the poorest areas in the District and was notoriously plagued by the phrase: “You cross the river, the doors close.” However, the residents who live there beg to differ on the matter, claiming that the community is interconnected “with a tradition of civic activism that brings people together over education, crime, transportation, economic development and other issues,” according to the Washington Post. Anne Allardyce captures the spirit of this community in her sculpture. The sculpture represents “connection” by depicting the interconnected world of the natural (represented by the river element) and the built world (the elements that bridge the river and create a gateway- from road systems to bus routes to metro lines). Allardyce stated that “coming across the river you are entering a real neighborhood-it is home…the station is a gateway across the river; the area is a gateway to the past and the future.” The doors are, in fact, open.",

The piece, a 20-panel stained glass design, is inspired by the Akan culture of Ghana and depicts the artist’s interpretation of the Sankofa bird. The Sankofa bird, with its head turned over its shoulder, signifies looking to the past for guidance for the future. Anderson used the images of Sankofa birds and Kente cloth to inspire residents to look back at their past to build the future of Columbia Heights.",

On the eastern garage façade eighteen stainless steel baseballs follow the trajectory of a curving fast ball pitch. The remaining twelve baseballs on the western garage facade illustrate the straight and higher-angled trajectory of the same ball as it is hit by the batter. The baseballs are lit with energy efficient LED lights. The lights are programmed to correspond with the excitement and drama of the baseball game.",

Matas\&#x27; loose, textured style and the mural\&#x27;s title both borrow from Buddhism, a philosophy that plays a major role in the artist\&#x27;s life.\n\nMatas re-did the mural\&#x27;s bottom portion after it was tagged with graffiti, when he covered it with figures shown looking at their mobile devices. Since then the mural\&#x27;s been repainted and reshaped a number of times.\n\n\nFrom the artist\&#x27;s interview on SF Weekly:\n\n\&quot;The first time, the house was a unified thing. I had no idea I\&#x27;d be doing an ongoing, evolutionary mural. It was blue into teal into white, top to bottom, using the words \&#x27;form\&#x27; and \&#x27;emptiness,\&#x27; and blending them into one another. \n\nI don\&#x27;t know if anybody could see it, but there was a profile of a face at the bottom. We normally associate the face with form. And the space around with emptiness, but I switched that, so the face was all made up of the word \&#x27;emptiness,\&#x27; and the background was made up of the word \&#x27;form.\&#x27; They blended into one another.\&quot;",

He made the towers out of rebar he bent himself, his own mix of concrete, and bits and pieces of bottles and broken dishes that he found in the neighborhood. The structure points east, toward Italy, and is built in the shape of the ship that brought him to America. The towers represent both the masts of the ship and a series of towers in the main plaza of the town in Italy where he was from. He finished the project in 1959, after 33 years of working on it every day after his job. The city of Los Angeles immediately tried to tear it down but the citizens of Watts organized and had the towers saved. They are now an historical landmark. Next time you find yourself in LA, I highly recommend you check them out.",

        description: "From the artists:\n\n\&quot;The art is a dynamic visual metaphor for the transformation [of the neighborhood] through its interaction of color and light. At night different light colors cause parts of the mural of that same color to be highlighted while other colors recede into the dark background. As the light colors shift, images appear to float in and out of the scene. This striking effect of \&quot;illumination animation\&quot; results in the appearance of an animated graphic abstractly representing a neighborhood in transformation, or Bayview Rising.\n\nGrowing out of a horizon line is a pattern inspired by native islais cherry plants overlaid onto a field of shorebirds rising from the water. Soaring above is a heron, alluding to nearby Heron’s Head Park, a nearby environmental restoration project by the Port. The cow references historic Butchertown, once sited at this location. The mural’s red balloons are inspired by words of 96-year old community activist Essie Webb, who likened the neighborhood to a balloon waiting to inflate and rise. The images within the mural have been combined, overlapped, and juxtaposed in a triangular matrix so there appear to be metamorphoses between cherries and balloons, water and birds, land and leaves. This shift is emphasized with the changing colors of lights.\&quot;\n\nFun Fact! This mural is 187 feet tall and is viewable from most of Bayview, and from I-280. It was painted on decommissioned grain silos.",

The audience will be invited to play the game and keep their score with the winner being conferred the title of “Anacostia Champion”.  Interaction with participants will create discussions, lead to story telling, and even the possibility of playing other street games. The night will culminate with a chalk drawing of an image being drawing out on the surface of the building.\n\nCome out and play tomorrow night!",

        description: "The Air Shaft Tunnel project is one of the original Public Art projects commissioned by the DCCAH.  Artist Val Lewton took on the challenging task of designing a painting for the colossal structure, with help from son Chris Lewton, artists Carter Green, Mike Hartigan, Victor Korenev , and Laura Murray. Val Lewton proposed that the shaft be returned “as close to its pristine concrete form as possible.” He noted that he wanted to maintain the “Stonehenge” look of the structure, which he felt makes a surreal statement about the city which itself exists without embellishments.  Working from a 1/3 scale mock up and laying out portions on the Shaft in a grid pattern, the team accomplished this daunting task   The final product (located at 3rd St. and Mass Ave. NW) includes two large window illusions painted on the structure. They reveal the Capitol dome and pillars that are, according to Lewton, “openings for our imaginations about the real city beyond the Capitol dome” which “beckon us to enter the city’s dark, mysterious core.” ",

        description: "This sculpture shows a bust of the famed Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes looking down at two of his characters, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza who kneel in reverence while looking back up at him. \n\nThe bust was based on a 1600s portrait, the only portrait of Cervantes known to be done from life. Unfortunately the lance held by Quixote had to be replaced after the original was lost during the winter of 1995.\n\nThe sculpture was given as a gift to the City of San Francisco by J.C. Cebrian and E.J. Molera,  two long-time residents and friends who came to San Francisco from Madrid together in 1860. It was dedicated on September 30, 1916.",

In 1909 his widow donated the portico to the city of San Francisco in memory of her husband. Mayor James Phelan to Park Superintendent John McLaren who placed it in its current location. \n\nIt was named \&quot;Portals of the Past\&quot; after a quote by poet Charles Kellogg Field describing the forward-looking nature of San Franciscans.\n\nThe San Francisco Arts Commission contracted Architectural Resources Group to restore the monument in 2008, which included recreating a missing columns and repairing the column\&#x27;s capitals.",

A few murals were added sporadically after that until 1984, when artist Ray Patlan brought three dozen mural activists together and proposed a joint project in which each garage door or fence segment facing the alley would display a mural. All of these murals were connected by dual theme: celebration of indigenous Central American cultures, and protest of U.S. intervention in Central America. \n\nSince then the walls have been repainted consistently.

        description: "This mural was painted from April – July 1998 and funded by the Mayor’s Office of Community Development under the Block Grant Program, SOMAR, South of Market Cultural Center’s Mural Resource Center, and by the Chinatown Community Development Center.\n\nInscription:\n“This mural is based on photographs the children and youth made while playing on the old playground equipment in the summer of 1997. They wanted to memorialize the old equipment with its high poles and their leaping, acrobatic game of tag which previous generations had created here and passed down. On the old equipment, the game took incredible balance, strength &amp; daring, and the youth were proud of their high flying skill. They chose these pictures as the subject of the mural. A variant of this game is still played in the redesigned playground.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, while the artists were painting and the children were playing, a shooting took place in the playground. Fortunately, everyone survived. This mural is dedicated to the survival, but more than that, to the continued flowering of the Chinese community of San Francisco — especially to its running, leaping children and youth, their courage, dreams and aspirations — our inspiration.\n\nWe want to thank the 100 or more people who painted with us on the community painting day, and all those who offered their criticism and encouragement as we drew and painted from April – July, 1998.\nWe especially want to thank the woman who paused so often in her afternoon walks to shout encouragement: ‘Hao liang! Hao liang! Very beautiful!\&#x27;”",

Originally it was placed at the Church of St. Francis in North Beach, but six years later it was moved to Oakland because its placement at the church was controversial. It was later moved to its current location in 1962 when the San Francisco Bay Area Longshoremen’s Memorial Association proposed a permanent location on their grounds.\n\nIt\&#x27;s co-owned by the San Francisco Bay Area Longshoreman’s Memorial Association and the Warehousemen’s Union.\n\nFun Fact!

It was funded by industrial tycoon James Mervyn Donahue in honor of his late father who began California’s first ironworks and machine shop in 1850.\n\nThe artist envisioned the monument as a giant punch press machine that took five men to operate. When the sculpture was first unveiled, the nude male figures caused an uproar, but the campaign to add pants to the figures failed.\n\nInscription:\n“Dedicated to mechanics by James Mervyn Donahue in memory of his father Peter Donahue”",

        description: "\&quot;Before Rocky III, released in 1982, Stallone commissioned A. Thomas Schomberg to create a bronze statue of Rocky.[7] Three 2-ton, 10-foot-tall copies were cast. One was installed atop the steps for the filming of Rocky III and was ultimately relocated at the bottom of the steps. The second one is in the San Diego Hall of Champions Sports Museum in San Diego, California. The third was later listed on eBay with a starting bid of US$5,000,000 to raise funds for the International Institute for Sport and Olympic History, but has failed to sell at that price or several times since at $1 million.[8]\n\nAfter filming was complete, a debate arose between the Art Museum and Philadelphia\&#x27;s Art Commission over the meaning of \&quot;art.\&quot; City officials, who argued that the statue was not \&quot;art\&quot; but a \&quot;movie prop\&quot;, eventually moved it to the front of the Wachovia Spectrum in South Philadelphia.[citation needed]\n\nIt was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of Rocky V, Mannequin and Philadelphia, then brought back to the Spectrum. The statue was replaced with a bronze inlay of Converse sneaker footprints with the name \&quot;Rocky\&quot; above them.[citation needed]\n\n\&quot;On September 8, 2006, the Rocky statue was returned to the Art Museum and placed on a pedestal in a grassy area near the foot of the steps to the right of the Museum. The unveiling ceremony included live music, the debut of the first full trailer for Rocky Balboa, and a free showing of the first Rocky movie. At the ceremony, Mayor John Street said that the steps were one of Philly\&#x27;s biggest tourist attractions, and that Stallone, a native New Yorker, had been gladly adopted by Philadelphia.[citation needed]\n\nIn Rocky Balboa, when Rocky tells Paulie that he is going to make a comeback, Paulie suggests, \&quot;You mad because they took down your statue?\&quot;, but Rocky denies this.\&quot;",

        description: "This project was part of the “Community Initiatives” project developed by the DCCAH, which seeks to involve community input in the planning process of public art. In 2001, a community meeting was held for Westminster Playground, allowing for members of the community to contribute their vision of what the playground should be like.  One of the resulting projects commissioned by the DCCAH was this mural, entitled “Community,” by Anne Marchand.  The mural, located on the building in front of the playground, acts as a colorful and welcoming backdrop.  True to the title, the theme of the mural is an interconnected community. Images, such as a vibrant rendition of the cityscape and neighborhood architecture, a protective crossing guard and children playing together, as well as various historical references such as jazz musicians and a trolley, all capture the vivacious essence of the Shaw neighborhood. An image of the Capitol alludes to the fact that the area is only blocks away from the center of our nation’s capital and elicits a sense of pride. This redesigned playground has since become a focal point for the Shaw neighborhood.",

        description: "The latest work in McDonough’s Awning Studies series, the project was developed during WPA’s 2011 Public Art Residency (PAR) Program at Socrates Sculpture Park (SSP, the Park) in Long Island City, NY. As the 2011 Public Art Residency Artist, McDonough carried out a two-month residency at SSP from July 1 through September 2, 2011. The resulting project, titled Awning Studies: Socrates, was installed in the Park from September 10, 2011 through March 4, 2012.\n\nAwning Studies: Marvin Gaye Park adapts the project to its new environment and continues McDonough’s exploration of the awning form as the key domestic vernacular architectural adornment of the northeastern United States. The project takes the form of a series of fabricated awnings without buildings installed on existing infrastructure, on the ground, and rising on columns of steel supports. With Awning Studies: Marvin Gaye Park, the artist continues to emphasize the relationship between his awning structures and the architecture of the surrounding neighborhood, an emphasis that was also present in the two earlier iterations of the series, Awning Studies: Florida Ave NE and Awning Studies: Socrates. Located in the historic Deanwood neighborhood, Marvin Gaye Park is surrounded by residential architecture with features that mirror the structure of McDonough’s project. The work’s proximity to a recreation center and newly renovated playground provides an ideal context for McDonough’s ongoing exploration of leisure space and free time and connections between these notions and issues of art making, art viewing, use value, and class.",

        description: "Hearts in San Francisco is an annual public art installation started in 2004 by the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation for the purpose of fundraising. The project is inspired by the international CowParade exhibit, in which cow sculptures are painted by various artists and installed in various cities throughout the world. The choice of hearts is inspired by the Tony Bennett song \&quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco.\&quot;\n\nEach year, uniform heart sculptures are painted by different artists and installed at locations throughout San Francisco, including Union Square. The heart sculptures are auctioned off at the end of each year\&#x27;s installation with the proceeds going to the foundation. Many of the previous years\&#x27; sculptures are exhibited in various locations, including San Francisco City Hall, San Francisco General Hospital, AT&amp;T Park (inside the Public House pub), the Lyon Street Steps, the Cartoon Art Museum, and several Wells Fargo branches.As of 2013, approximately $10 million had been raised for the foundation.\n\nLearn more:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_in_San_Francisco",

Using acrylic paint, these students created a mural with a theme of children, music, art and education. The mural “serves as a source of pride helping to ground our community in our core values”says Gabriel Rojo, property owner.  Elements of the students’ own identities are infused with the positive message of the mural, as can be seen by the hip-hop element which is represented, for example, by the speakers painted onto the buildings.",

He was responsible, for example, for the creation of the school’s award winning band.  The DCCAH commissioned local muralist G. Byron Peck to create the mural with the help of Shaw students, staff, and neighborhood residents, and it now hangs at the entrance to the school’s auditorium.  This project was thus not only a means to commemorate the former principal, but also a way to instill pride in neighborhood and school history as well as to build a relationship between the school and community through art.

        description: "This statue was given as a gift to the City of San Francisco in 1879 by Dr. Henry Cogswell, a dentist who made his fortune providing gold fillings during the Gold Rush. It was moved from its original location on Kearny Street to the center of Washington Square Park in 1904.\n\nInscriptions:\n• The base reads “Welcome” on all four sides.\n• The dedication on the back reads, “To Our Boys and Girls, Who Will Soon Take Our Places and Pass On.”\n\nFun Fact! The statue’s stone base is a time capsule that was first opened in 1979 by then-mayor Dianne Feinstein, and won’t be opened again until 2079. Its current contents include a pair of Levi’s jeans, a poem by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, a bottle of wine, and a copy of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City.",

Using eleven high-definition video projectors, Aitken will seamlessly blend imagery to envelop the Museum\&#x27;s exterior, creating a work that redefines cinematic space. A bold commission that will enter the Hirshhorn\&#x27;s permanent collection and enliven its public space, \&quot;SONG 1\&quot; allows visitors to the National Mall a chance to witness the first-ever work of 360-degree convex-screen cinema.\&quot; More at http://hirshhorn.si.edu/exhibitions/view.asp?key=21&amp;subkey=518",

Industrialization followed and 20th century shipbuilding kept driving the area\&#x27;s urbanization. The Opera House in the middle panel is the Ruth Williams Memorial Theatre at 4705 Third Street. It\&#x27;s the oldest theater in the city and a registered historical landmark.\n\nColor lights up the following panels depicting Sam Jordan\&#x27;s bar and protests in support of equality and environmental policy. Sam Jordan was a boxer best known as \&quot;Singing Sam\&quot; because he would sing before and after his fights. He opened his bar on 3rd Street in 1959 where, for more than four decades neighborhood regulars and city leaders would drop by on their way to or from Candlestick Park nearby.",

The 49ers built a railroad on top of the creek when they arrived, and this mural depicts the 1860s bridge that used to be located here at 16th and Harrison.\n\nThis mosaic was commissioned by the Madrina Group, a nonprofit “working to make San Francisco’s historic industrial neighborhoods more healthy and livable through environmental education and urban planning initiatives.” It was funded by New Langton Arts‘ Potrero Nuevo Fund.\n\nFun Fact! The Mission Creek mosaic is 15 feet long and 8.5 feet tall.",

        description: "\&quot;I spent 3 months in china studying ancient and contemporary art. I also have a large birth mark on my forehead. These two things lead to the image of the koi fish as possibly a symbol of me. Then when I moved to San Francisco I realized they are the colors of the Giants. I think they have became so popular because one there on the sidewalk. It’s technically no one’s personal property and belongs to the city. But the fact that they seem to have little to no direct statement behind them but a beautiful image to look at is what I feel has made them as popular as they are today. They have been able to cross boundaries unlike so many other things in the world. In San Francisco they have been able to reach the young, the old, the rich, the poor, the educated and the uneducated. You could find yourself sitting at a bus stop with someone of a different race, age, gender, and social class and yet be able to have a conversation about the koi fish as the likely hood of the other person seeing them is pretty high. Advertisement company’s wish their images could do that.\&quot; - Jeremy Novy interview: http://gonetomorrowsf.com/2011/05/31/an-interview-with-jeremy-novy/",

        description: "Black Bird Benches are among six art benches and eight monumental outdoor artworks along the Foss Creek Pathway, a public arts project commissioned by the Voigt Family Sculpture Foundation and the city of Healdsburg, California.\nBlack Bird Benches are crafted of sleek triangular sheets of powder-coated steel painted medium gray with hints of blue. Each of the three benches is slightly different from the rest in the way that the steel is bent. Although Black Bird Benches are tilted at angles not ideal for sitting, the benches are designed as works of aesthetic sophistication rather than of functionality.\nBlack Bird Benches were created jointly by Al Voigt, founder of the Voigt Family Sculpture Foundation; Chris Bernroth, board member of the Healdsburg Chamber of Commerce; and Rebecca Nase, metal sculpture artist originally from Vermont.\n\n",

        description: "Dedicated to the famed Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi, this monument was a gift to the City of San Francisco from its Italian Community. The group was spearheaded by Ettore Patrizzi owner and publisher of San Francisco’s Italian newspaper L’Italia (published form 1887 to 1943). \n\nThe commissioned artist was decided through a contest held at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. The allegorical figures at the base of the monument represent the four muses; Love, Tragedy, Joy and Sorrow -- the fundamental elements thought to have inspired most great artists.\n\nThe monument was restored in 2003 and a new dedicated plaque was added. The bronze bust of Verdi was regilded, along with an inscription on the rear face of the granite pedestal.\n\nFun Fact! The famed Italian soprano singer Luisa Tetrazzini, sang the aria from Verdi\&#x27;s opera Aida to an audience of more than 20,000 at the monument\&#x27;s dedication. ",

        description: "This sculpture was dedicated in 1897 and commissioned by San Francisco’s mayor in honor of California’s admission to the Union. The angel on top is supposed to have been modeled after the artist’s wife, and the open book she carries is inscribed with the date California officially became a state: “September 9, 1850.”\n\nThe figure waving the flag below is a miner holding a pickaxe. Originally this sculpture was installed farther down Market at Mason and Turk, but after 51 years it was relocated to Golden Gate Park. When the Native Sons lobbied to have it returned to Market Street, it found its current home in 1977.\n\nInscriptions:\nFront of the base:\n“‘The unity of our\nEmpire hangs on\nthe decision of\nthis day’\nW.H. Seward\nOn the admission\nof California\nU.S. Senate\n1850″\n\nBack of the base:\n“This fountain\nis dedicated to\nthe Native Sons\nof the Golden West\nto commemorate\nthe admission\nof California\ninto the Union\nSeptember the ninth\nanno domini\nMDCCL”",

        description: "\&quot;While serving his Peace Corp time in India, Shapiro saw many Indian art works, and has said that \&#x27;India gave me the sense of … the possibility of being an artist.” In India “Art was pervasive and integral to the society,\&#x27; and he has said that \&#x27;the struggle in my work to find a structure that reflects real psychological states may well use Indian sculpture as a model.\&#x27;\n\n...\n\nHis later works can have the appearance of flying, falling, being impossibly suspended in space, and/or defying gravity. He has said about this shift in his work that he \&quot;wanted to make work that stood on its own, and wasn’t limited by architecture and by the ground and the wall and right angles.”\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Shapiro",

        description: "\&quot;Zoe Ani‘s work ranges from representational to abstract landscapes. She explores various mediums, such as encaustic, oil and watercolor. Each brings a unique characteristic that challenges her efforts to stay present. \n\nZoe articulates the rural and urban visions around me that change in dramatic fashion by focusing on her experience in the moment. A constant resource are Zoe’s own photographs as well as working from memory.\&quot;\n\nThis mural was painted as part of the SFAC\&#x27;s StreetSmARTS program. ",

        description: "Alice Aycock is a member of the group of artists (Laurie Anderson perhaps a better-known member) who came artistic age in the early 1970s, grappling with the stylistic transition from modernism to postmodernism.  Although her pieces feel architectural, they are not, as Aycock has said:  ”… functional architecture, but architecture as an umbrella from which you could hang many things—psychology, history, or culture.”\n\nAycock has held a life-long obsession with the nature of reality;  that is to say, her work deals with various states of mind and body, sometimes real, but often fictional, sometimes downright peculiar. But always complex. Typically, her work mines a vast array of references—physics, psychoanalysis, literary, computer programming, mental disorders, even ancient languages.  This subject matter makes for intensely psychological environments.\n\nLearn more: http://venetianred.net/2009/09/25/bay-area-favs-alice-aycocks-fantasy-functional-staircase/",

        description: "This mural was first painted in 1987 and restored by the artist in 2004. The Columbus Street side chronicles the local jazz scene, including the trio with Benny Goodman on clarinet, Gene Krupa on drums, and Teddy Wilson at the piano. The “Mayor’s Corner” is painted where the mural’s two walls meet, featuring prominent politicians in San Francisco’s history.\n\nThe Broadway Street side includes a Chinese dragon and an Italian fisherman pulling in his net. This spot is where North Beach meets Chinatown, so the mural’s subject matter represents the world where three cultures meet: Chinese, Italian and English.\n\nFun Fact! The artist included a self-portrait in the bottom-right corner, where he painted himself holding a palette. He also had to move Dianne Feinstein over 12 inches to include Willie Brown (mayor from 1996-2004) in the Mayor’s Corner when the work was restored in 2004.",

Adam and Eve sit atop a giant apple-shaped book on the right as San Francisco landmarks rise above the bookshelf\&#x27;s other half on the left. \n\nGreen Apple Books owner Pete Mulvihill explained the mural\&#x27;s inspiration: “The store’s name is derived from the Adam and Eve story – in picking the apple, they chose knowledge over utopian bliss. Hence the Adam and Eve theme. Beyond that starting point, it was Bryana’s creation.”\n\n",

        description: "“New Leaf” was installed in 2007 by the Georgia Avenue/Petworth Metro Station by Lisa Scheer as part of the Art in Transit Project. Scheer was inspired by a proposal stating the importance of the planting of trees on the site.  She stated that “oak leaves are often regarded as symbols for long life, strength, and endurance.  A leaf…can be read as a metaphor for the bounty inherent in growth and personal development or it can signify the cyclical nature of life suggesting continuity and the hope that comes with renewal and rebirth.”  The bronze sculpture measures approximately six by nine by four feet, and on its spine is inscribed a poem by Washington poet E. Ethelbert Miller that reads; every leaf surrenders to air, we dance, we flutter, we touch the earth. Scheer felt that the poetry would allow the public to find a deeper, more personal connection to the sculpture.  She also noted that the practice of writing on leaves has its roots in ancient history “and implies a freedom of expression, a releasing one’s feelings into the world.”",

        description: "\&#x27;Formerly known as Sandton Square, Nelson Mandela Square is linked to Sandton City and is one of the most fashionable destinations in Johannesburg, offering 93 exclusive shops and boutiques, as well as fine dining experiences and sidewalk cafes. \n\nNew York has the Statue of Liberty, Egypt the Great Sphinx and Brazil the Christ the Redeemer statue. And Sandton, South Africa? We have a world famous statue of the man who led our country to an equal rainbow nation, Nelson Mandela.\n\nStanding six meters tall and weighting 2.5 tons, the bronzed Nelson Mandela statue in the Nelson Mandela Square was unveiled on the centre’s 10-year anniversary in March 2003. The unveiling also served as a celebration of 10 years of democracy in South Africa as well as the renaming of the centre from Sandton Square to Nelson Mandela Square.\n\&quot;",

        description: "In 2007, the DCCAH, in partnership with the Department of Parks and Recreation, commissioned local artist Walter Kravitz to design paintings on the glass windows inside the King Greenleaf Recreation Center.  Kravitz, who also designed artwork for the Hillcrest Recreation Center, stated his enthusiasm in working on recreation center artwork: “Recreation centers are a stabilizing factor in communities. When I was growing up in Chicago, our recreation center was an answer to the street.” Thus, the project hit close to home for Kravitz. He created colorful, lively images of men, women, seniors, youth, and some disabled participating in various activities and sports that take place at the center. The paintings create a welcoming and vibrant environment and act as one of several projects commissioned by the DCCAH with the goal of revitalizing D.C.’s recreation facilities. ",

        description: "Led by local artist Nicole Andrijauskas, this mural was painted with the art students of A.P. Giannini Middle School. It commemorates the Giannini’s contributions to San Francisco families after the 1906 earthquake. \n\nThis mural was funded by the Claire Giannini Foundation in honor of the 102nd anniversary of her birth. It celebrates Amadeo Peter Giannini who founded the Bank of Italy (which later became Bank of America), and his daughter Claire who became the first woman director of Bank of America in the early 20th century.

        description: "\&#x27;Brian Goggin stands on a lift 20 feet up, knotting sailor\&#x27;s rope to fasten a piano that dangles precariously over the sidewalk.\n\nThe one-ton replica piano of glass and rusted steel, and 12 others like it, represent \&quot; ... And My Room Still Rocks Like a Boat on the Sea ... (Caruso\&#x27;s Dream),\&quot; a public site-specific artwork commissioned by the developers of AVA 55 Ninth, a 17-story apartment complex on Ninth Street, between Market and Mission.\n\nKnowing Goggin\&#x27;s taste for the theatrical, the pianos in the sky could have been seen as performance art, but this art is permanent - more permanent than \&quot;Defenestration,\&quot; Goggin\&#x27;s masterpiece of furniture hanging out the windows of the Hugo Hotel on Howard Street.\n\n\&quot;Caruso\&#x27;s Dream\&quot; is still under construction and will not debut until the building is completed in February. Until then, the sidewalk beneath the artwork is closed, but if you walk down the other side of the street, you can see the shapes of a grand, a baby grand and an upright, missing only the legs and the keys. If you get the feeling of an earthquake that propelled all these pianos into the sky and they are on their way back down, you\&#x27;ll be in the right direction.\n\n\&quot;The whole piece is inspired by this moment when the opera star Enrico Caruso was awakened by the Great Calamity of April 18, 1906, while he was staying at the Palace Hotel,\&quot; Goggin says. \&quot;He did not know if he was awake or still dreaming as he was walking to the window to see the results of the ongoing earthquake.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;Caruso\&#x27;s Dream\&quot; is a joint production of Goggin and Dorka Keehn, the team that brought the celebrated \&quot;Language of the Birds,\&quot; an installation of blinking books, to the corner of Broadway and Columbus.\n\nThe $750,000 commission came through a nationwide competition of 40 artists, organized by the Black Rock Arts Foundation, which started at Burning Man but now focuses on creating urban art experiences outside the desert.\n\nGoggin got the inspiration while studying South of Market history, when he read about a specific grand piano that was used to plug a sinkhole.\n\n\&quot;Potentially that piano is still under Mission Street today,\&quot; he says.\n\nTo build the 13 pianos, Goggin and Keehn collected 900 pieces of chicken-wire glass of different textures and colors.\n\nThe wooden struts that support the pianos were salvaged from pilings in the old Transbay Terminal. The ropes used to lash the piece are modeled after nautical hemp, tied in knots used by longshoremen.\n\n\&quot;The idea behind that is to work with materials that are rooted to the site historically and physically going back to when it was a factory neighborhood,\&quot; says Goggin, 47, who grew up in Davis, the son of state Assemblyman Terry Goggin.\n\nBrian Goggin moved to San Francisco in 1988, and got his start in 1994 when he created \&quot;Herd Morality,\&quot; consisting of 35 Queen Anne tables jumping off the roof of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.\n\nScheduled for six weeks, it lasted nine months, but he broke that record with \&quot;Defenstration,\&quot; which was supposed to be up six months and has lasted 15 years at the corner of Sixth and Howard. An armoire, clocks, a bathtub, fans, lamps, chairs and tables all seem to be jumping out of the windows and climbing down the walls. Civic efforts to permanently protect the artwork and the building it decorates have failed, and \&quot;Defenestration\&quot; will finally come down when the building is razed this summer.\n\nGoggin\&#x27;s original plan was to top \&quot;Defenestration,\&quot; but the building would not support it. \&quot;I\&#x27;d been looking for the opportunity to hang an upright piano off the side of a building for many years,\&quot; he says. \&quot;While \&#x27;Defenestration\&#x27; is coming down, \&#x27;Caruso\&#x27;s Dream\&#x27; is going up, so it felt important to consider that relationship.\&quot;\n\nThe grand opening for all these grand pianos is Feb. 23, and anyone who remembers the dedication of \&quot;Language of the Birds\&quot; five years ago will not want to miss it.\n\nThat piece, which consists of 23 illuminated books that fly above the plaza at Broadway and Columbus, was opened with a Fellini-esque carnival. There was a marching band, with poetry readings by local literary figures. The dramatic climax came when Goggin, in plaid suit and handlebar mustache, climbed a 30-foot extension ladder to untangle a veil stuck to one of the sculptures.\n\nFor the opening of \&quot;Caruso\&#x27;s Dream,\&quot; he plans a New Orleans-style parade, in which 13 working pianos will be wheeled from \&quot;Defenestration,\&quot; down Howard Street and up Ninth. Gathered beneath the 13 suspended pianos, the real ones will be played by 13 pianists accompanying three opera singers, who will conjure the spirit of Caruso.\n\nA music and light component will be permanent. At night, the glass pianos will shine from within, like old incandescent bulbs. The sound of Caruso singing will be on KPH (Palace Hotel), recreating a station that once emanated from the hotel. At 90.9 on the FM dial, it will have a reach of 300 feet.\n\nThat gets it all the way across Ninth Street, to the headquarters of Twitter.\n\n\&quot;I see a parallel with computers, iPads, iPhones and that type of thing,\&quot; Goggin says. \&quot;Where now, communities gather around these tech devices, it reminds me of people gathering around these pianos that were a product of the Industrial Revolution.\&quot;\n\nCaruso\&#x27;s Dream: The site-specific installation by Brian Goggin and Dorka Keehn is at 55 Ninth St., San Francisco. Grand opening is set for Feb. 23.\&#x27;",

        description: "Lamont Park, located in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, D.C., is the focal point of the Mount Pleasant business area.  A challenging aspect of the Mount Pleasant area is that it is heavily divided; the neighborhood’s main street divides the more affluent part of the neighborhood from the area dominated by apartment buildings where many residents are immigrants.  Lamont Park became a gathering place for residents, regardless of what neighborhood they came from, thanks to revitalization efforts such as artistic sculptures by artist Hestor Nelson. New artwork made the park more welcoming and thus beckoned the community to come together for play time and special events. Nelson’s artwork includes a variety of ceramic elements decorated with patterns and designs from African, Native American, pre-Columbian, Greek, Japanese, and other cultures from around the world.  Her creations, for example, include a gateway consisting of two ten foot columns and a redwood canopy that rest on a medallion of brick in a herringbone pattern.  This is one of many public art projects sponsored by the DCCAH that not only beautifies an area, but also brings the community together.",

Josh Gibson played with the Washington Homestead Grays, which was the African American team, from 1930-1941. With 10 home runs in 1943 alone, he was considered to be one of the best catchers and power hitters in the history of baseball, and he helped lead the Grays to eight of nine Negro national League titles.  He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.",

        description: "Referring in part to the brief residency of a Cooper’s Hawk in the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress in 2010, and archive images of the Graf Zeppelin near the Capitol in 1928, Isabella Streffen’s Hawk and Dove is a film using footage shot from two 7ft remote-controlled zeppelins – the Hawk and the Dove – engaged in a balletic ‘dogfight’ at the Library of Congress and Martin Luther King Library. In a city whose existence owes everything to the exercise of political power, Hawk and Dove literally explores the corridors of power and the role of knowledge in the shaping of political debate.  ---- March 20 - April 27 ---- The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities\&#x27; 5x5 project will exhibit 25 ground-breaking public art installations commissioned by artists from around the world.",

Canliao and crew will gather discarded refuse and create a surreal installation, infused with Native American references, which transport the viewer to a dreamlike world. ---- March 20 - April 27 ---- The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities\&#x27; 5x5 project will exhibit 25 ground-breaking public art installations commissioned by artists from around the world.",

        description: "In 1993, artist Ed Hamilton was commissioned by the DCCAH to design a memorial for the African American Civil War Memorial.  Previously, not one monument in the District honored the 178,000 black soldiers who fought in the Civil War.  The Spirit of Freedom is the first to commemorate the United States Colored Troops, who came into being in 1863 after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, stating that former slaves were to be received into the armed services.  The sculpture depicts a line of Civil War infantry and sailors and the family figures they were leaving behind.  It stands on a plaza in one of Washington’s oldest black neighborhoods, Shaw, at 10th and U Street.  According to Hamilton, it is “a narrative piece…This tells what they are really fighting for.”",

        description: "From TBD.com (http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-neighborhoods/2010/08/new-craig-kraft-neon-sculpture-lighting-up-shaw-406.html):\n\nAmong the ongoing changes to the lot where the brand new Watha T. Daniel/Shaw Library now stands is a sculpture by local artist Craig Kraft.\n\nKraft, who\&#x27;s lived and worked just down the street from the library for decades, spent most of the day Saturday installing the piece at the entrance to the new library branch at 7th and Rhode Island NW. The job involved the help of professional art movers, a crane, plus a number of electricians, and took about eight hours to complete.\n\nThe sculpture itself, which Kraft has titled \&quot;Vivace,\&quot; was co-commissioned several years ago by a conglomeration of city agencies, and was actually originally designed to go along with one of the earlier versions of the once-stalled replacement library. The library that was eventually built, conceived by architecture firm Davis Brody Bond Aedas, had literally no influence on Kraft\&#x27;s piece, since he started working on it long before the building plans had been drawn. Still, Kraft says he\&#x27;s happy with the end result.\n\n\&quot;It\&#x27;s a nice contrast,\&quot; Kraft says. \&quot;It is a focal point out there and it does draw people in.\&quot;\n\nWhen it first commissioned the piece, the city asked artists to interpret Shaw\&#x27;s history in terms of its relationship to jazz, which Kraft says was an easy place for him to start.\n\n\&quot;I\&#x27;ve always listened to a lot of jazz, and I\&#x27;ve been in here in Shaw for 20 years,\&quot; he says. \&quot;Good jazz has an improvisational quality, but it also has an underlying structure. So in this piece, the ribbons kind of gather in the center, but then they kind of move unpredictably from there.\&quot;\n\nThe neon sculpture will be illuminated only at night, starting at about 8 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\n",

        description: "This 52-foot monument was commissioned by James Lick for $60,000 and given as a gift to the City. The bronze statues were cast in Rome and brought by ship to San Francisco. Its been suggested that Lick commissioned the monument because he was also in Fort McHenry on September 13, 1814 --  the night of the shelling that inspired Key\&#x27;s lyrics. \n\nThe monument has been relocated three times. Originally it was erected behind the Auditorium where the tennis courts now are in what used to be a playground. From 1909 to 1966, it was in front of Steinhart Auditorium. It was installed at its current location in 1977 when it was rededicated as part of Bicentennial celebrations on July 4, 1976. Two time capsules containing memorabilia and records are buried at its base.\n\nHere Francis Scott Key is seated under an arched canopy topped with a standing female figure of Columbia.

        description: "The artwork, a monumental-size mosaic mural, was commissioned by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities in cooperation with the Metro Art in Transit Program. The mural of multi-colored ceramic and glass tiles mounted on aluminum panels spans 400 square feet. It measures 14 feet high and 39 feet wide, and weighs 2,000 pounds. The artwork can be found at the station on the southern abutment wall along Cedar Street.\n\nThe DC Commission, Metro and the Takoma Metro Mural Committee, a committee formed specifically for the project, selected Gilliam from among 132 artists who submitted applications for the commission.\n\n\&quot;I wanted to make a work that is part of its environment, yet changes that environment,\&quot; said Gilliam. \&quot;A work filled with color and light.\&quot;\n\nSince the early 1960s, Gilliam, with his signature draped canvases, has challenged the traditional painting techniques of the Washington Color School and Abstract Expressionism. During the \&#x27;70s Gilliam\&#x27;s wrapped canvases pushed his aesthetic explorations even further. By the \&#x27;80s Gilliam began applying sculptural elements to his surfaces - making three-dimensional sculptural paintings. Currently he creates, along with his signature works, multimedia installations and translations using various techniques and media. \&quot;From a Model to a Rainbow\&quot; is a mosaic translation of one of Gilliam\&#x27;s earlier paintings. Gilliam\&#x27;s work is included in private and public collections around the world. He lives and maintains a studio in northwest Washington, DC.",

Yellow background, landscape view of the Capitol. \&quot;Part of the The Georgia Avenue Global Mural, this piece is one of the five murals created along one of Washington, DC\&#x27;s main corridors, Georgia Avenue, as part of a grant-funded project that explored the city\&#x27;s cultural and social issues. This particular mural is titled The Great African Migration, and portrays the immigration of people of the African Diaspora emerging into Washington\&#x27;s communities. Being a first generation American of Ethiopian descent, this painting reflects Helina\&#x27;s own personal narrative.

        description: "This project was part of the “Community Initiatives” project developed by the DCCAH, which seeks to involve community input in the planning process of public art. In 2001, a community meeting was held for Westminster Playground, allowing for members of the community to contribute their vision of what the playground should be like.  One of the resulting projects was a series of paintings with the theme “Play Together and Live as One” by artist Jerome Meadows, each of which are nestled into the niches along the playground. His brightly colored, dynamic paintings add a pleasing aesthetic to the playground and a cozy vibe that appeals to adults and children alike. The redesigned playground has since become a focal point for the Shaw neighborhood. ",

        description: "This phenomenal work of art, entitled “U Street Sound” and created by renowned artist Walter Kravitz, was commissioned by the DCCAH in 1997.  “U Street Sound,” which hangs in the lobby of the Reeves Municipal Center, is a vibrant and colorful semi-kinetic structure, and the theme draws on the rich history of U Street.  It features a group of 16 musicians that are 8 feet tall.  As jazz is a vital part of the history of U Street, Kravitz stated that he “wanted to use the idea of jazz music to inspire me to make a work.” His work truly transformed the Reeves Municipal Center into a brilliant visual representation of the area’s history and culture.",

Mayer stated that he wanted to “capture and mirror the energy and vibrance of Dupont,” a unique area that is home to a wide array of people, cultures, architecture, and businesses. The mural is made up of different sized circles and ovals which intertwine and float amongst one another, creating a modern feel that reflects the constant activity of the Dupont area.  In creating this project, Mayer coordinated with the Dupont Circle Citizens Association, ANC 2B, Dupont Main Streets Project, the Dupont Farmers’ Market, and the Dupont art galleries. ",

He added an overhang at the top to protect the mural from the weather, says  Riverdale Park Mayor Ann Ferguson.\n\nRiverdale Park officials  fought in 1998 to preserve the mural after an Eckerd\&#x27;s Drugstore proposed demolishing the building to open a new store. Residents protested and eventually won the battle to keep the mural and the building. Ferguson says in October 2000 the municipality purchased the land underneath the mural to plant flowers and  build a small park. For now, the mural will not be torn down. \n\n\&quot;It\&#x27;s an identifying marker,\&quot; Ferguson says. \&quot;When Eckerd\&#x27;s Drugstore threatened that corner (East-West Highway and Baltimore Avenue), a lot of people from the surrounding area were inflamed. \n\n\&quot;They said, \&#x27;I count on that mural when I see it.

        description: "Lamont Park, located in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, D.C., is the focal point of the Mount Pleasant business area.  A challenging aspect of the Mount Pleasant area is that it is heavily divided; the neighborhood’s main street divides the more affluent part of the neighborhood from the area dominated by apartment buildings where many residents are immigrants.  Lamont Park became a gathering place for residents, regardless of what neighborhood they came from, thanks to revitalization efforts such as artistic sculptures by artist Hestor Nelson. New artwork made the park more welcoming and thus beckoned the community to come together for play time and special events. Nelson’s artwork includes a variety of ceramic elements decorated with patterns and designs from African, Native American, pre-Columbian, Greek, Japanese, and other cultures from around the world.  Her creations, for example, include a gateway consisting of two ten foot columns and a redwood canopy that rest on a medallion of brick in a herringbone pattern.  This is one of many public art projects sponsored by the DCCAH that not only beautifies an area, but also brings the community together.",

        description: "This project was part of the DCCAH’s Community Initiatives, which seeks community input for the beautification of our neighborhood streets, side walks, and parks.  Activists hoped to transform Unity Park, which was once described as dangerous and in a state of disrepair, into a “miniature Dupont Circle.” The DCCAH acknowledged this and commissioned Adams Morgan resident and artist Jerome Meadows to create a sculpture for the park.  Entitled “Carry the Rainbow on Your Shoulders,” Meadows’ work consists of a sculpture of a child, embellished with rainbows, riding on an adult’s back, as well as a fountain pool and planting area.  Engraved in the sculpture is the sentence: “Unity through Diversity.”  Meadows’ sculpture illustrates a cohesive community and provides a positive outlook for the future of Unity Park.",

        description: "This outdoor gallery was designed to “deliver nature’s beauty directly to the Excelsior Community.” The five artworks take viewers on an imaginative journey through the natural world. \n\nThe project was funded by a Community Challenge Grant awarded to SF Clean City and managed by the Excelsior Action Group. It\&#x27;s the first of many outdoor galleries planned for this wall - a new rotation of work from local artists is expected every three-five years.\n\n“Washington Crossing the Delaware” \nby Katherine Kodoma \nacrylic paint \n”Through this dreamlike depiction of trees crossing the Delaware, it is my intention to bring awareness of global deforestation to the Excelsior. Choosing a patriotic theme, ‘Washington Crossing the Delaware’ the trees have similar movements to the figures, but here they are peaking above the San Francisco fog with Mt. Diablo in the distance.”\n\n”Bayscape” \nby Matt Christenson \nacrylic paint \n“Bayscape brings multiple natural settings of the San Francisco Bay Area together in one composition. Using scenes of Mt. Tamalpais, Mt. Diablo, John McLaren Park, Golden Gate Park, Fort Funston, and Ocean Beach, Bayscape aims to remind the citizens of San Francisco that they live in a city immersed in and surrounded by the beauty of nature…” \n\n“Anna’s Hummingbird” \nby Nico Berry \nspray paint and acrylic paint \n“When I first moved to the Excelsior district my family and I were enchanted by the hummingbirds who come to visit our garden almost every day. They are a beautiful reminder of the natural world that lives alongside the hustle and concrete of the city.” \n\n“Granite Dome” \nby Zoe Ani \nspray paint and India ink \n“When I moved to California from New York, part of the reason was to spend more time in nature. It is much more accessible here. The panel exhibited here is based on a photo I took the first time I visited Yosemite. The immensity of the granite dome, peering out from the trees as we rounded the bend upon entering the park, was a shocking and breathtaking view.” \n\n“Tree Graph” \nby Michael Hall \nacrylic paint \n“McLaren park has been my backyard for over 50 years. Walking through the park in the Fall I was struck by this scene. Vivid orange, almost lurid reds, bright yellows and shifting tones of blue sky against the cool green of the cypress. I took several photographs to capture it all. Then I thought, why not paint it as separate images on one canvas…”",

        description: "The DC Commission of the Arts and Humanities’ (DCCAH) Kaleidoscope Project at the 14th Street Bridge Operator’s Tower just received its final touches. Artist Mikyoung Kim installed LED lighting to enhance the experience of the work at night. The lights will remain on from 4pm to Midnight each night. The kaleidoscopic sculptures are constructed out of dichroic and reflective acrylic that create refracted light compositions at each window. While installing the lights, the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) helped with traffic control. The refurbishing of the Operator’s Tower is part of DDOT’s ongoing 14th Street Bridge Project.

        description: "Echoing the inscriptions of authors\&#x27; names on the outer walls of the former building, 160 names of writers are illuminated on a wall that rises five stories behind the grand staircase.\n\nThe artist\&#x27;s work is inspired by a Beaux Arts tradition with origins in the BibliothÃ¨que Saint-Genevieve in Paris (a model for the old Main Library). On that building, authors\&#x27; names were inscribed on	the facade according to the location of their works inside.\n\nNayland Blake revisits this idea of an index of authors with glass shades placed before fiber optic light beams. Each shade is inscribed with the name of an author whose work is part of the library collection. The wall is designed to hold 200 more names as patrons endow additional shades and lights.\n\nTo select the first 160 names, the artist formed a guidance	committee of local scholars and community members to develop a list of recommendations. Blake then held a series of public meetings in the branch libraries to solicit community response, as well as suggestions.\n\n- See more at: http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000023301#sthash.BIhKyFz7.dpuf",

We have a dynamic where we just explain things to each other once and we get it.  It’s a dynamic where we don’t have to talk much because there is trust. \n\nWe can just get in the groove and paint. This makes the process so much fun and you lose track of time. All of this is so evident in this new collaboration by me and Gathe. Time definitely does fly when your’e having fun.\&quot;",

        description: "From http://bsiw.stanford.edu/art_gallery/exhibits.html\n\n\&quot;Current Exhibit: Collisions Between Historical Visions: The Art of Enrique Chagoya\n\nSeptember 20, 2010 through January 2011\n\nCollisions Between Historical Visions is an exhibition of work−including painting, drawing, sculpture, and printmaking (digital and traditional)−created by Stanford University Art and Art History Professor Enrique Chagoya. Many of the pieces are informed by Chagoya’s experiences throughout his life, including his time in Europe and on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. By juxtaposing secular, popular, and religious symbols from various places and periods−including pre-Columbian mythology, Western religious iconography, ethnic stereotypes, ideological propaganda, and American popular culture−Chagoya’s art frequently addresses cultural clashes over both space and time.  This dynamic drives much of his work:\n\nThe art becomes a product of collisions between historical visions, ancient and modern, marginal and dominant paradigms - a thesis and an anti-thesis that end in a synthesis in the mind of the viewer.\nIn addition to winning the 2010 Kala Master Artist’s Award from the Kala Institute, a Bay Area leader in printmaking experimentation over the last forty years, Chagoya will serve as the Navigation Press distinguished visiting artist at George Mason University during October 2010.\&quot;\n\nFrom: http://pinklineproject.com/event/4129\n\nCOLLISIONS BETWEEN HISTORICAL VISIONS: THE ART OF ENRIQUE CHAGOYA\n\n\&quot;The Bing Stanford in Washington Art Gallery is proud to host \&quot;Collisions Between Historical Visions: The Art of Enrique Chagoya.\&quot; This exhibition of paintings, drawings, sculpture, and prints highlights cultural clashes of religious iconography, ethnic stereotypes, ideological propaganda, and pop culture.\n\nEnrique Chagoya was born in Mexico and received a BFA in printmaking from the San Francisco Art Institute and a MF / MFA at the University of California Berkeley. Chagoya\&#x27;s art commonly addresses cultural clashes over space and time. He currently serves as a Professor of Art and Art History at Stanford University and has been chosen as the 2010 Navigation Press distinguished visiting artist at George Mason University.\&quot;\n",

        description: "“The Glory of Chinese Descendants”, a breathtaking structure created by artist Foon Sham, literally lights up the Chinatown/Gallery Place Metro Station with vibrant shades of blue, red, orange, and yellow. The structure, which represents a Chinese fan, rests atop the metro exit leading to Chinatown and reflects a theme relevant to the area’s culture.  The fan signifies the artistic and high class aspect of Chinese culture, and the choice of twelve sections on the fan represents the Chinese lunar calendar that repeats in cycles of every twelve years.  As Chinatown is nestled in the midst of our nation’s capital, the color scheme symbolizes the intertwined Chinese and American cultures: the combination of the blue and red lights on the top and the soft white of the Plexiglas emphasize the American colors while the red, orange, and yellow lights on the bottom emphasize the Chinese colors.

        description: "In 2003, William Wegman completed a photomural for the L’Enfant Plaza Metro Station.  Wegman used two photographs of his weimaraner dogs in faux NASA space suits to create two 10-foot-in-diameter porcelain enamel circular photomurals to be installed on the interior walls at station entrances. Wegman, who is known for including his beloved canine companions in his works, combined his own personal flair with a theme relevant to the area. The space scene was chosen for the L\&#x27;Enfant Plaza station because of its close proximity to NASA Administrative Offices and the National Air and Space Museum, and the work was funded in part by the NASA Arts Program.",

Baker stated that it represents “a simple story of mothers banding together demonstrating community spirit and determination to create a safe recreational environment for their children and community.” The second, entitled “Swimming Pool,” depicts several children and adults in their expressed moments of exuberance and joy as they play in the facility’s swimming pool. Both murals portray the ability of the recreation center to band the community together.",

The work, inspired by her Boxers series from 2004, was painted on the home of art collector Veronica Jackson. This project was funded by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, an agency supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nThe project generated significant attention which was covered locally by DCist, in the Washington City Paper and by local tv stations MSNBC and ABC 7. Boxer Girl was also included in an article on controversy surrounding public murals by Artnet News. ",

Mark di Suvero at Crissy Field also represents the crowning “community tribute” to the Golden Gate Bridge, closing the celebrations of the 75th Anniversary year.\n\nThe exhibition is the result of a unique collaboration between SFMOMA, the National Park Service, and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, this outdoor exhibition brings together works spanning five decades from across the country, including one, Mother Peace, returning to the Bay Area, where it was created for the first time since 1974.\n\nAbout di Suvero:\n\nDi Suvero\&#x27;s early works were large outdoor pieces that incorporated wooden timbers from demolition buildings, tires, scrap metal and structural steel. This exploration has transformed over time into a focus on H-beams and heavy steel plates. Many of the pieces contain sections that are allowed to swing and rotate giving the overall forms a considerable degree of motion. He prides himself on his hands-on approach to the fabrication and installation of his work. Di Suvero pioneered the use of a crane as a sculptor\&#x27;s working tool.",

Uniquely sited within view of the Pacific Ocean, the Ortega Branch Library is a source of ‘abundant knowledge’, a place where people of all ages come to learn and grow. Likewise, the nearby ocean is a wellspring of sustenance, offering an ‘abundance of resources’ for both humans and animals alike.\&quot;",

Val’s work, entitled “Quadrature Nimbii” and which features shapes of buildings silhouetted against clouds and sky, reinforces a spatial illusion that contributes to a feeling of openness. The lighting, which is incorporated into the art work, also helps to enliven the area.  The ceiling is no longer a typical bland white, and government employees and visitors alike can enjoy this Sistine Chapel-like ambiance as they walk through the foyer. The importance of art in D.C. life as well as the intertwined nature of D.C. government and art is symbolized by “Quadrature Nimbii.”",

        description: "From the artist, David Willis:\n\nThe 35\&#x27; x 35\&#x27; mural, called Druid Heights, was painted in acrylic on a three stage scaffold.\n\nMy daughter, 20 years old, is an artist who painted the butterfly, a mission blue and worked on the cat. She attended the Ruth Asawa School of the Arts in San francisco and is now, amongst many other things, designing T-shirts at Free Gold Watch on Waller Street in SF.\n\nThe painting is a view down Frank Valley, near Mill Valley in Marin County, looking from Panoramic Highway towards the fog at Muir Beach, with Muir Woods out of sight off to the right. \n\nAlso hidden behind a hill is the Druid Heights community where I lived in 1974-5 that has recently been suggested as being a national treasure because of its association with Alan Watts, the Buddhist writer and former Church of England priest, who lived and died there. The builder craftsman Roger Sommers, who also lived there, built many of the buildings hidden from the building inspectors in the woods. Among the structures are Alan Watts\&#x27; library, repurposing a large water tank, and a tiny shack built in \&#x27;67 known as the Goat House that inspired the recent Tiny Homes Movement. I was a room-mate in Druid Heights of Margo St. James who begat the prostitutes rights group Coyote and the infamous Hookers Masquerade Balls and for whom I designed the logo and many posters. \n\nThe large bird is a Snowy Egret, male in breeding plumage. The smaller egret is a female and is painted elongated to allow for the perspective view down the side alley.\n\nI am an expat England person, other works by me are at the Haight Ashbury Tobacco store front at 1525 Haight with portraits of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, and the painting over the entrance to the Tibetan Gift Corner at Haight and Clayton showing a traditional Tibetan scene of sheep, horses and 2000 yaks. I also am a graphic designer working for Lloyd Kahn at Shelter Publications in Bolinas, recent publication are, Home Work, Tiny Homes and Builders of the Pacific North West.\n\nEmail Mr. Willis at dctwills@earthlink.net",

        description: "Pod was designed by native Portland resident Pete Beeman as a public art project for the Portland Streetcar.[3] According to Beeman and the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council, the modern sculpture is designed to represent the \&quot;infrastructure, energy, and vibrancy of Portland\&quot;. \n\nOf the work\&#x27;s design, Beeman said:\n\n\&quot;I was thinking about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great. I was thinking of the static tripod as the infrastructure. The moving part was the vibrancy and life.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;The most interesting part of the sculpture will be watching people try to move it.\&quot;\n\nPod is constructed from stainless steel, galvanized steel, bronze, titanium, lead, plastic and rubber. The 30-foot sculpture is supported by its static tripod base with a 14- to 15-foot diameter.\n\nEach of the three \&quot;legs\&quot;, cut to size by BBC Steel, stand 14-feet tall and are grounded by two cubic yards of cement. The central pendulum structure consists of 73 titanium rods; each of these connects to a \&quot;star fruit\&quot;-shaped bronze bulb at the base of the pendulum.[5] Pod was fabricated by Beeman and David Bermudez, and engineered by Beeman and Peterson Structural Engineers.[6] The work is considered interactive and kinetic; the central, vertical pendulum swings back and forth when pushed. The upper and lower parts of the pendulum \&quot;swing and flex in different rhythms, affecting each other\&quot; until returning to a resting position.[6] Pod cost $40,000–$50,000 and was funded by the Portland Streetcar Project and BBC Steel.\n\nLearn more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pod_(sculpture)\n",

        description: "SINCE opening in 2006, Long View Gallery has been operating in the Shaw Neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Our focus has been on promoting the Washington area\&#x27;s burgeoning art community by highlighting local and regional artists on its exhibit walls. Through our many special events, we have brought artists into the community and hope to continue that mission for years to come. Monthly exhibitions as well as a growing permanent collection showcase a diverse group of both established and emerging new artists. Long View Gallery presents Washington D.C.\&#x27;s fresh talent. Our knowledgeable staff offers design consultations, delivery and access to in-house master framing.\n\nPART gallery/part event space, Long View Gallery\&#x27;s new home boasts a bevy of desirable attributes. With 5,000 sq ft and 20 ft ceilings, the space can hold up to 400 guests for corporate events and private functions.  Modern track lighting along with accommodations for caterers, DJs, and access to the historic Blagden Alley, make the Gallery a premiere spot for hosting and gathering. The venue\&#x27;s blank canvas appeal and flexibility to work all types of events and budgets makes the space highly desirable and completely unique in the metro area. The urban and upscale feel that lends itself to the space has already attracted attention from such clients as Lexus, who hosted a Lexus Listening Lounge event series featuring the legendary sounds of Motown in early October.",

        description: "This mural was directed by Susan Cervantes, Suaro Cervantes and Fred Alvarado. It was designed by 27 local participants of all ages who centered their themes around celebrating the spirit of the community. \n\nGoing from left to right, first there\&#x27;s a banner with the names of the Potrero Hill Health Center in English, Spanish and Chinese framed by a peace sign and a rainbow heart..\n\nOn the main mural wall, its left side centers around the children getting on the school bus and dreaming of their future graduation. \n\nFrom the artists:\n\&quot;At the top of this hill is an “all seeing eye” of hope and respect. A red tailed hawk carries the path of life towards the sun. In the foreground are maguey cactus, a canna flower and hummingbird, California poppies, sunflowers and nopal cactus. Behind the sunflowers is a pregnant woman practicing the “tree pose” with nurturing hands in a circle around her representing the 5 elements of fire, water, earth, wood and metal, the foundation for good health ad balance. \n\nAround the mural is a border framing the mural with names of community heroes.\&quot; \n\nFinally, the wall covered with giant ladybugs have been decorated by handprints from the local community.",

        description: "\&quot;\n\nAustin’s “Hi, How Are You” frog mural on a building at 21st Street and Guadalupe is one of America’s most famous pieces of street art. It was painted by Texas outsider artist and musician Daniel Johnston, who, despite being mentally ill, has had songs covered by Tom Waits and Beck and his art displayed at the Whitney Museum. The iconic painting, a bug-eyed cartoon bullfrog named Jeremiah the Innocent, has been put on baby onesies, T-shirts and even iPhone apps. Johnston said, “It’s the way that the town remembers me.”\n\nThe frog mural represents a lot of things to people in Austin. To me, it’s a monument to a time when there was no point to cynicism, and street protest was the most viable form of activism I could imagine.\n\n \n\nStreet protest gets a bad rap these days, and for good reason. Despite hundreds of thousands of marchers during the lead-up to the war in Iraq, despite more than 1 million demonstrators nationwide rallying for immigration reform, despite even more people in London, Pittsburgh and Toronto protesting the G20 summits, the result was: a war with Iraq, a failed immigration bill, and agreements among G20 nations that took no account of the masses in the street.\n\nThe idea of a protest changing anything? Even teenagers have become too cynical to buy into that. \n\n \n\nJohnsTon painted the mural in 1993 on what was then a record store, Sound Exchange. It quickly became a landmark. Something about the simple outline of a frog with a vague half-smile and those words—“Hi, How Are You”—connected with something whimsical. The painting is part of why I’ve made Austin home—I’ve always loved living in a city of people who could look at a simple mural and agree that it said something about who we were.\n\nTen years after the painting was commissioned, Sound Exchange closed. Eulogies for the “old Austin” abounded, as they do whenever a local business in the Keep-It-Weird district shuts down. I was as sad as anyone—I lived five blocks away, and Sound Exchange was my record store.\n\nAfter several months, the building was rented to Baja Fresh Mexican Grill, a fast-food restaurant under the Wendy’s umbrella.\n\nThe morning of Jan. 5, 2004, a friend overheard construction workers at the site say that the day had come: They were scheduled to tear down the frog mural so it could be replaced with windows. I hustled over and found some workers taking pictures in front of the frog. They were sad, they said. Everybody in Austin liked the frog.\n\n \n\nThere have been numerous editorials about whether street protest still works. The Daily Kos’ Markos Moulitsas devoted a chapter of his 2008 book Taking on the System to the question, and other bloggers and pundits have been trying to find an answer. Mostly they conclude that it doesn’t. It’s hard to argue with the facts.\n\nI was 23 in 2004, and those conclusions sounded cynical and closed-minded. So when I left the site of the soon-to-be Baja Fresh, I used the proto-social networking websites of the day (Friendster, etc.) to recruit people to think up words that rhymed with “frog” for chants.\n\nA few months earlier, to protest the war, we’d marched in groups of several thousand down Congress Avenue, from the steps of the Capitol to the river, only to see our numbers underreported and our message lost among the Free Mumia/Legalize It/Free Tibet noise-to-signal ratio. For the frog—a local cause being protested by a  local group of about 30—we obtained as much TV and print coverage as we’d hoped for.\n\nThe stories started to fall into a “Requiem for a Frog” line on how sad everyone was that the mural was being destroyed. One protester had an idea: Instead of railing about the frog, why didn’t we call the guy who was building the Baja Fresh?\n\n \n\nJohn Oudt started the Texas Restaurant Group after selling the Barq’s root beer brand to Coca-Cola in 1995. Today his son Randall handles the day-to-day responsibilities of the company, but the elder Oudt oversaw the development of the Baja.\n\n“It was quite a surprise,” he said when I asked what it was like when he got a phone call informing him that a few dozen protesters were outside his building. “I thought the painting was just an accumulation of graffiti,” he said.\n\nWhen I spoke to him that afternoon years ago, I insisted that the mural wasn’t graffiti—it was art. Much to my surprise, Oudt heard me out.\n\n“I’m not a young guy, and this isn’t my first rodeo” he said. “I’ve been involved in areas around universities before, and I knew that the attitudes that people have about you are extremely important if you’re trying to open a business in an area like The Drag.”\n\nHe met us at the frog site and apologized, said if he’d known it meant something to us, he’d have found a solution. As it was, plans had been approved, and everything was underway. He was polite and sincere, and offered to see if the workers could cut the mural out very carefully, if I had room for it in my West Campus studio apartment.\n\nWe shook hands, and he thanked us for letting him know about the mural. Walking home, I took the fact that he’d shown up as a victory, but the next morning, he called me.\n\n“I couldn’t sleep last night,” he said before explaining that he’d decided to save the mural. We held a press conference that afternoon, at which he said he expect-ed it to cost him $50,000 in architect fees and lost revenue to preserve it, but that it was important to him.\n\n \n\nThe late House Speaker Tip O’Neill famously said that “All politics is local.” Most of the demonstrations held up as proof that protest doesn’t work have been about big national and international issues. A group in Toronto isn’t going to change what leaders in South Korea and Turkey and Australia decide about the G20; amassed immigrants in Chicago and Dallas aren’t liable to effect change on an issue that’s so divisive throughout the country; a bunch of people with signs down in Texas aren’t able turn heads in the Pentagon.\n\nIf I were still in my early 20s, that might sound like cynicism to me. When it feels hopeless, though, I just have to go back to my old neighborhood to see that big, googly-eyed frog to remember that when you keep your focus on your immediate world, you can be a lot more powerful than you’d have thought.\n\nThat afternoon in 2004, a few friends drove by while we were demonstrating. They’d been with me a few months earlier, marching through downtown to protest the war, and this time they thought what we were doing was funny—“You’re going to have to get a real job sometime, frog boy!” But when they drive down Guadalupe today, that mural is still there.\n\nIt means something different to them than it does to me, I’m sure. Just like it means something different to Daniel Johnston himself, or to the photography students at the University who shoot pictures of it every semester, or the guy on YouTube who put up a video of himself standing in front of it and explained that, “Standing before Daniel Johnston’s mural in Austin, Texas, was a highlight of my trip across the United States.”\n\nTo me, the mural means something about the kind of difference a person can make, and that O’Neill’s maxim was right. If I’d listened to the part of me that agreed that the wrongs of the world were too big to fix, all of us—my friends and I, Daniel Johnston, the photo students and the guy on YouTube—would be walking past the building where Jeremiah the Frog used to live and wishing we could bring him back. \n\n \n\nDan Solomon lives in Austin. His work has appeared in The Onion A.V. Club, Spin, Austin Monthly and Asylum.com.\&quot;\n\n",

        description: "\&quot;For current real estate purposes, the block where the Brooklyn rapper Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace, once sold crack is now well within the boundaries of swiftly gentrifying Clinton Hill, though it was at the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant when he was growing up. Biggie, who was killed under still-mysterious circumstances in 1997, was just one of the many rappers to emerge from Brooklyn’s streets in the ’80s and ’90s. Including successful hardcore rappers, alternative hip-hop M.C.s, respected but obscure underground groups and some — like KRS-One and Gang Starr — who were arguably all of the above, the then-mean streets gave birth to an explosion of hip hop. Among the artists who lived in or hung out in this now gentrified corner of the borough: Not only Jay-Z, but also the Beastie Boys, Foxy Brown, Talib Kweli, Big Daddy Kane, Mos Def and L’il Kim.\n\nFor many, the word “Brooklyn” now evokes artisanal cheese rather than rap artists. The disconnect between brownstone Brooklyn’s past and present is jarring in the places where rappers grew up and boasted about surviving shootouts, but where cupcakes now reign. If you look hard enough, the rougher past might still be visible under the more recently applied gloss. And if you want to buy a piece of the action, Biggie’s childhood apartment, a three-bedroom walk-up, was recently listed by a division of Sotheby’s International Realty. Asking price: $725,000.\&quot;",

        description: "\&quot; 7000 Oaks by Lynne Cooke with statements by Joseph Beuys\n\nI believe that planting these oaks is necessary not only in biospheric terms, that is to say, in the context of matter and ecology, but in that it will raise ecological consciousness-raise it increasingly, in the course of the years to come, because we shall never stop planting.1\n\nThus, 7000 Oaks is a sculpture referring to peoples\&#x27; life, to their everyday work. That is my concept of art which I call the extended concept or art of the social sculpture.2\n\nI wish to go more and more outside to be among the problems of nature and problems of human beings in their working places. This will be a regenerative activity; it will be a therapy for all of the problems we are standing before.... I wished to go completely outside and to make a symbolic start for my enterprise of regenerating the life of humankind within the body of society and to prepare a positive future in this context.\n\nI think the tree is an element of regeneration which in itself is a concept of time. The oak is especially so because it is a slowly growing tree with a kind of really solid heartwood. It has always been a form of sculpture, a symbol for this planet.3\n\nThe planting of seven thousand oak trees is thus only a symbolic beginning. And such a symbolic beginning requires a marker, in this instance a basalt column. The intention of such a tree-planting event is to point up the transformation of all of life, of society, and of the whole ecological system...4\n\nThey are basalt columns that one can find in the craters of extinct volcanoes, where they become a prismatic, quasi-crystalline shape through a particular cooling process-which produces these shapes with five, six, seven, and eight corners. They could, and still can, be found lined up like perfect, beautiful organ pipes in the Eifel region. Today, most of them are protected. But we didn\&#x27;t have to have these particular splendid organ pipes, we just wanted a material with basalt characteristics from the environs of Kassel. So there we found basalt columns which are part crystalline, that is to say, they have sharp corners, but at the same time tend toward amorphousness. 5\n\nMy point with these seven thousand trees was that each would be a monument, consisting of a living part, the live tree, changing all the time, and a crystalline mass, maintaining its shape, size, and weight. This stone can be transformed only by taking from it, when a piece splinters off, say, never by growing. By placing these two objects side by side, the proportionality of the monument\&#x27;s two parts will never be the same.\n\nSo now we have six- and seven-year-old oaks, and the stone dominates them. In a few years\&#x27; time, stone and tree will be in balance, and in twenty to thirty years\&#x27; time we may see that gradually, the stone has become an adjunct at the foot of the oak or whatever tree it may be.6\n\n\nWith these statements, Joseph Beuys has provided an unusually extensive and detailed account of the aesthetic and philosophical impetus underlying the realization of his work 7000 Eichen (7000 Oaks). This project was inaugurated at Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany in 1982, in a plan which called for the planting of seven thousand trees, each paired with a columnar basalt marker measuring approximately four feet above ground, throughout the greater part of the city. Brought from a quarry some thirty kilometers from Kassel, the stones were initially heaped on the lawn in front of the Fredericianum, Documenta\&#x27;s principal exhibition building. On March 16th of that year, several months prior to the opening of the exhibition, Beuys himself planted the first tree with its accompanying stele.\n\nThe action continued over the next five years under the aegis of the Free International University, the diminishing pile of stones in front of the Fredericianum indicating the progress of the project. Planting in public spaces in the inner city was carried out on the basis of site proposals submitted by residents, neighborhood councils, schools, kindergartens, local associations, and others. The result, according to Norbert Scholtz, offered significant opportunities for \&quot;occupying and utilizing \&#x27;public\&#x27; open space socially.\&quot;7\n\nAt the opening of Documenta 8 in June 1987, some eighteen months after his father\&#x27;s death, Beuys\&#x27;s son Wenzel planted the last tree. While sixty percent of the trees employed in Kassel were oaks of several varieties, fifteen other species were also incorporated, including ash, chestnut, crab, elm, gingko, hawthorn, locust, maple, and walnut.\n\nFor most of the first two decades of his career, Beuys\&#x27;s principal activity as an artist was focused on the sites of the art gallery and museum. However, in the 1970s, as he consolidated his philosophy outlining a social revolution effected in part by the transformative powers of art, he increasingly directed his attention toward a broader public. Thus in 1972, for the hundred-day duration of Documenta 5, he engaged in public debate with whomever he encountered in his improvised office for Direct Democracy. Teaching and lecturing continued to preoccupy him throughout the remainder of the decade, often under the auspices of the Free International University or the Organization for Direct Democracy, both institutions he had helped launch. In addition, he became a founding member of the Green Party whose mandate originally encompassed ecological and environmental issues in an extraparliamentary arena.\n\nWhile it is appropriate to view Beuys\&#x27;s project 7000 Oaks primarily in the context of his own work and artistic activity, parallel concerns engaged certain contemporary artists elsewhere. In the United States the so-called land or earth art projects of the late 1960s and \&#x27;70s had been initiated in part by a wish to reconnect with the larger world outside the urban environment, by a concern to circumvent the mechanisms of the established art market, and by a desire for greater participation on the part of a broader audience. In different ways, works such as Walter De Maria\&#x27;s The Lightning Field (1977), James Turrell\&#x27;s ongoing project at the Roden Crater, and both Robert Smithson\&#x27;s and Robert Morris\&#x27;s involvements with land reclamation projects on abandoned sites ravaged by strip mining have affinities with Beuys\&#x27;s concurrent activities and interests. Yet, 7000 Oaks is characteristic of this German artist in that it could both function as a small-scale, intimate project, the outcome of individual initiative, as well as a highly ambitious, potentially vast undertaking meant to be replicated elsewhere. In this regard it accords well with his intensified focus during the 1970s on the production of multiples, that is, objects usually intended to be available at low cost in very large editions. Like such works as Noiseless Blackboard Eraser (1974, edition 550), and Wooden Postcard (1974, edition c. 600, signed), 7000 Oaks functions not just literally, in practical environmental terms, but symbolically, as \&quot;inspirational images.\&quot;8 It embodied, metonymically, Beuys\&#x27;s utopian and poetic metaphysic of a social sculpture designed to effect a revolution in human consciousness, \&quot;the human being as a spiritual being.\&quot;9 By means of its permanence and longevity it also sought to render \&quot;the world a big forest, making towns and environments forest-like.\&quot;10 For Beuys intended the project as realized in Kassel to be only the first stage in an ongoing scheme of tree planting (with or without accompanying markers) to be extended throughout the world. Subsequently, single trees with stones have been placed at strategic sites, including the front of the art academy in Oslo, and at major events, such as the Fifth Biennale of Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe Dia Art Foundation provided the initial financing for 7000 Oaks in Kassel.11 Now, as Dia Center for the Arts, it has continued the project in New York with the planting of several different kinds of trees, each aligned with a basalt stone, in front of its exhibition facility at 548 West 22nd Street. Further expansion will take place in 1995 with the siting of additional trees and steles on the north side of the street at Dia\&#x27;s new venue.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Beuys chose the number 7000 partly because he felt \&quot;seven represents a very old rule for planting trees\&quot; (and he referenced such towns as Seven Oaks in the U.S. and its namesake in England), and because it coincided with the seventh Documenta. Dismissing 70 and 700 as too few to signify the idea, he settled on the number 7000 as one which\&quot; will be a very strong visible result in 300 years.\&quot;\n\n11. In addition to the initial funding provided by Dia, further sources included individual tree sponsorships, donations from many other artists, as well as significant contributions by Beuys himself.\&quot;",

Residents created patches that reflected community life and the history of Prince George’s County with the assistance of Dr. Joan Gaither and Cynthia York, two experienced quilters. On Saturday, May 12, a special program will take place from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in the mall’s Center Court near Macy’s, followed by the unveiling of this massive hand-stitched quilt. \n“We are pleased to welcome the Community Quilt to The Mall at Prince Georges as a reminder of the rich cultural history of our area and of the beauty we can create when we work together as a community,” said Victoria Clark, mall marketing director. “The Mall at Prince Georges is the ideal location to display this creative quilt as we are a true centerpiece to the community and a popular shopping destination for area residents.”\n The unveiling event will feature a performance by a Spoken Word Artist. Additional highlights include a speech about the purpose of the quilt from Dr. Jacqueline F. Brown, PGAAMCC Executive Director; a poetry reading by youth members of the Culture Keepers and the blessing of the quilt from Reverend Jerome Fowler. The event will conclude with the highly anticipated unveiling of the king-sized quilt.\nThe inspirational quilt will be displayed at The Mall at Prince Georges until the grand opening of the new PGAAMCC museum which is expected to break ground in 2015. The community is invited to visit the mall to view the beautiful piece of artwork and enjoy the masterful work of their neighbors. \nThe Community Quilt is part of Prince George’s African American Museum and Cultural Center’s award winning program, Culture Keepers. Culture Keepers is an AFTER-SCHOOL &amp; SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM where high school and middle school students are engaged in visual arts, performing arts, and docent training/career development.

        description: "\&quot;For the “bootleg artist” known as Swampy, the world is an endless living canvas. Variations on his signature “swampdonkey” tag — the skull of some imaginary tusked creature — can be found in almost every imaginable setting across America: dilapidated skyscrapers in Oakland, Calif.; train trestles in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; gallery walls in Atlanta or Brooklyn. Though he’s best known for his graffiti, Swampy’s output varies wildly and incorporates a kaleidoscope of materials, styles and settings. His studio is almost entirely mobile, his materials are liberated as needed from large art supply chains, and he travels entirely for free by hopping freight trains.\&quot;",

        description: "\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Paul Conrad\&#x27;s \&quot;Chain Reaction\&quot; sculpture in Santa Monica, the subject of a grass-roots preservation campaign, might well survive to remind future generations of the horrors of nuclear war.\n\nNow that activists have raised funds to pay for some of the needed upgrades, the city manager said he plans to recommend that the city cover the remaining costs. A City Council vote is scheduled for Feb. 25.\n\nConrad, a three-time Pulitzer winner who died at 86 in 2010, was paid $250,000 by a private donor to sculpt the work. The 51/2-ton, 26-foot-tall sculpture features a mass of tangled chains in the shape of a mushroom cloud. The artwork — inscribed with the words, \&quot;This is a statement of peace. May it never become an epitaph\&quot; — has stood at the Santa Monica Civic Center since 1991.\n\nAt first, Conrad planned to build the sculpture of easy-to-maintain bronze. Instead, it was crafted of copper tubing over a fiberglass core and stainless steel frame.\n\nIn 2011, a city official raised concerns about the sculpture\&#x27;s safety after he saw children climbing on it.\n\nHampered by the loss of redevelopment money, the City Council in March 2012 approved the sculpture\&#x27;s removal but allowed supporters several months to raise funds to save it.\n\nThe city\&#x27;s Landmarks Commission voted unanimously in July 2012 to designate \&quot;Chain Reaction\&quot; a local landmark, complicating the removal plan.\n\nJerry Rubin, a local peace activist, co-founded a group called Save Chain Reaction and began rallying support. Along with David Conrad, the late cartoonist\&#x27;s son, Rubin has spent nearly two years raising money, in the process garnering the support of celebrity activists, including Michelle Phillips and Alexandra Paul.\n\n\&quot;The council challenged the supporters of \&#x27;Chain Reaction\&#x27; to raise funds for the structural stabilization of the sculpture, and approximately $40,000 has been raised,\&quot; City Manager Rod Gould said in an email Friday. \&quot;Staff will recommend that council accept the funds and provide general funds to undertake the required structural investigation and restoration work to ensure public safety.\&quot;\n\nEstimates for repairs have ranged wildly, with the city floating a possible price tag of $400,000.\n\nRubin, who turned his 70th birthday party last month into a fundraiser, said in an email that \&quot;the community and Conrad family have shown Santa Monica that \&#x27;Chain Reaction\&#x27; deserves to be saved and respectfully refurbished.\&quot; He added that his group would continue fundraising and adding to its more than 3,600 online petition signatures. A $100-per-guest tribute to Conrad, featuring entertainer Harry Shearer and journalist Robert Scheer and a benefit auction, is scheduled for Jan. 13. For information, see the Save Chain Reaction website.\n\nConrad was The Times\&#x27; editorial cartoonist for 29 years, during which he won three Pulitzer Prizes for his insightful, sharply aimed drawings. Joan Kroc, the late San Diego philanthropist and nuclear disarmament proponent and widow of McDonald\&#x27;s founder Ray Kroc, paid the original $250,000 cost for the sculpture. It was built according to Conrad\&#x27;s designs by Peter Carlson, who also fabricated scores of large sculptures for other artists, including Robert Rauschenberg, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein and Jeff Koons.\n\n\&quot;There has been a tremendous amount of public outpouring of support,\&quot; said Councilwoman Gleam Davis, who supports the preservation effort. \&quot;It makes sense for the council to honor the … hard work that has gone into raising money. This is a landmark, and we need to take care of it.\&quot;\n\nmartha.groves@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @MarthaGroves\n\nCopyright © 2014, Los Angeles Times\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-0105-chain-reaction-20140105,0,3565256.story#ixzz2pwX1VrNG\n",

There are also quotes from Spike Lee, Groucho Marx and Jorge Luis Borge, and the selections were chosen by community members and library patrons.  \n\nThe ‘cover’ of the book was created to look like a rock slab covered with petroglyphs, and the back cover features illustrations and symbols that show the history of Mission Bay.\n\nThis work was commissioned for the new Mission Bay Library as part of the Branch Library Improvement Program.",

        description: "The Bay Lights is the world’s largest LED light sculpture, 1.8 miles wide and 500 feet high. Inspired by the Bay Bridge’s 75th Anniversary, its 25,000 white LED lights are individually programmed by artist Leo Villareal to create a never-repeating, dazzling display across the Bay Bridge West Span through March 2015.\n\nThe Bay Lights is a monumental tour de force eight times the scale of the Eiffel Tower’s 100th Anniversary lighting. Shining from dusk until 2:00 a.m. for two years, it will impact over 50 million people in the Bay Area, with billions more seeing it in the media and online. By conservative estimates, $97 million dollars will be added to the local economy.\n\nSome facts:\n\n1.8 Miles:\nThe length of The Bay Lights from end to end (approximately 26.4 football fields)\n\n12 inches:\nThe space between individual LED lights in strand mounted on each cable\n\n500 feet:\nThe height of the installation to the tallest point\n\n300:\nThe number of vertical cables on the bridge that fitted with LED lights\n\n240 feet:\nThe length of the longest bridge cable \n\n2 feet: \nThe length of the shortest bridge cable\n\n728:\nThe number of power and data boxes used in the light sculpture system\n\n100,000 feet: \nThe linear feet of cable for power, fiber and Cat 5 wires in the system\n\n$8 Million:\nThe total cost of the project to make The Bay Lights a reality\n\nLearn more: http://thebaylights.org/",

        description: "This sculptural mural was painted by an artist’s collective that included Nicole Emmanuel, Lari Kilolani, James Morgan, Raymond M. Patlan, Eduardo Pineda, James Prigoff, O’Brian Theile and Horace Washington. \n\nThe six panels depict the 1934 Maritime Strike and were originally erected by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. When the Hotel Vitale was built in 2004, the sculpture was moved a short distance to where it stands now.\n\nInscription:\n“In memory of Howard Sperry and Nick Bordoise, who gave their lives on Bloody Thursday, July 5, 1934, so that all working people might enjoy a greater measure of dignity and security.\n\nSperry and Bordoise were fatally shot by San Francisco police at the intersection of Mission and Steuart Streets, when longshoremen and seamen attempted to stop maritime employers from breaking joint strike. Community outrage at these killings sparked a general strike by all San Francisco unions.\n\nThe maritime strike continued through the middle of summer, concluding with a union victory which brought decent conditions to the shipping industry and set the stage for the birth of a strong and democratic labor movement on the west coast.”",

In 2010 all of the fountains in the Music Concourse were restored by Joseph Chow &amp; Associates. The snake\&#x27;s head had disappeared long before and a recreation was made by artist Manuel Palos based on photos of the original.\n\nThe cast stone pool surrounding the sculpture was designed by architect Herbert A. Schmidt. The fountain was funded in the \&#x27;20s with a $10,000 gift from Corrine Rideout, the widow of banker Norman Rideout. ",

        description: "\&quot;I have two expressions to my iconography; my personal and my liturgical. My liturgical work I have expressed chiefly through my Neo-Byzantine icon project The Dancing Saints Icon of St. Gregory\&#x27;s Episcopal Church, San Francisco. This is a 2500 plus square feet icon mural that decorates the rotunda of the church\&#x27;s sanctuary and consists of a depiction of 90 oversize traditional and nontraditional \&quot;saints\&quot; from diverse times and cultures from all over the world. (This project was brought to a level of completion in Dec. of 2008.) The saints are all dancing with an even larger size Christ. Among the selected 90 saints are people like Malcolm X, Queen Elizabeth, Rumi, Ella Fitzgerald, Gandhi, Anne Frank, Cesar Chavez, John Coltrane (of course) and Sorghaghtani Beki, the mother of Kublai Khan. The artistic challenge was to translate the ancient Byzantine stylization and bring it to fresh and contemporary places while still honoring the ancient tradition. The iconographic difficulties of recognizable likenesses, culturally diverse costumes, ethnic diversity and different spiritual traditions, all brought together in a large scale work has given this project a unique place in the history of art and religious iconography.\&quot; http://deacondukes.blogspot.com/",

        description: "\&quot;Richard Serra\&#x27;s monumental \&quot;Sequence,\&quot; one of the distinguished sculptor\&#x27;s greatest achievements, is at last in the open air – just as it was always meant to be.\n\nThe Cantor Arts Center\&#x27;s installation of the 235-ton, contoured steel sculpture marks the first time the sculpture, created in 2006, has been shown outdoors. The work is open for a public viewing and walk-through beginning Wednesday, July 27.\n\n\&quot;Sequence,\&quot; part of the Doris and Don Fisher Collection, will remain at Stanford until it moves to its permanent location as part of the expanded San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2016.\n\nSerra\&#x27;s work blurs the boundaries between architecture, art and engineering. The curvilinear walls slant, creating a vertiginous experience as visitors walk through the two torqued ellipses connected with an \&quot;S.\&quot; As Serra explained the disorienting experience, \&quot;The \&#x27;S\&#x27; is a passage that reverses itself right in the center of the piece, and you might have the concern that you\&#x27;re walking back in the same direction you came from, but you\&#x27;re not.\&quot;\&quot;",

        description: "About Richard Ohanlon:\n\nO\&#x27;Hanlon\&#x27;s sculpture was an integral part of his entire lifestyle. In addition to his work, his home and studio in Mill Valley was always filled with beautiful objects: sculpture, drawings, paintings, photos, sea shells, fossils, dried plants, old tools, rock specimens, crystals, elegant machinery and parts of machinery, gears, butterflies, old bottles, and many other unexpected visual delights.\n\nHis wife Ann, who was also an artist, shared the creation of this world from the very beginning many years ago. He and Ann were great travelers and were able to make the most remote places seem desirable. Annoyances were overcome by enthusiasm for the aesthetic offerings. His account of trips from Europe to India and, most recently, China, displayed more than expansive good-natured fervor. What was revealed was an individual who could absorb accurately and in minute detail the important values to which he was exposed. Travel for Dick, with his wife Ann, was a pursuit for the essential qualities that each place had to offer and which their extraordinary discernment was able to grasp, and in turn, percolate and filter to their respective students, to the student\&#x27;s good. If Dick and Ann seemed to know almost everybody anywhere, it might be attributed to their way of relating the creative expression of many cultures.\n\nLearn more: http://bit.ly/12hfFgi",

        description: "About Mowry Baden:\n\nBorn in Los Angeles in 1936 and educated at Pomona College and Stanford University, Mowry Baden has lived and worked in Canada since 1971. He has practiced sculpture for nearly 50 years and has taught sculpture at Raymond College, Pomona College, UBC, and the University of Victoria, from which he retired in 1997.\n\nArticulating an internal awareness of movement has always been the most important element in his work. Over the past 43 years, he has developed various methods of decentering vision and interfering with habitual human gestures. He has built harnesses, furniture, rooms, pathways and catwalks, all with the goal of impinging upon the viewer\&#x27;s movements and awakening a physical self-awareness that was previously unconscious.\n\nBaden tries to provoke a perceptual crisis that assaults the viewer\&#x27;s confidence in the information that comes through the senses. His practice has always involved materials, just like any artist who makes objects. Ideally, however, he is less interested in the object than in the experience. He wants the viewer to enter the object (or the space) and have an experience that is visceral, internal, and sensorially cross-circuited.\n\nLearn more: http://www.mowrybaden.com/about.php",

        description: "\&quot;After being arrested for painting without permission in Williamsburg a few months ago, it looks like Kenny Scharf is sticking to commissioned gigs (most of the time). Following his \&quot;Amerikulture\&quot; show with Tseng Kwong Chi at Eric Firestone Gallery, Scharf headed back to the West Coast. This mural in Culver City was organized by Branded Arts to be painted on the side of a tire shop. His colorful, trippy art livens up the shop and the sad little busstop on the otherwise boring street corner. Legal work like this is cool, but Scharf isn\&#x27;t constrained by our silly laws.\&quot;",

        description: "This mural celebrates the life and work of Cesar Chavez, the founder of the United Farm Workers Union. His portrait is surrounded by roses, grapes, and other North American crops. The sun\&#x27;s bright rays symbolize Chavez\&#x27;s enduring spirit. \n\nChavez in the center is holding the hand of the child, and together the two march forward toward their future. The grape vines weaving between the school’s windows represent the life, work and struggle of the people who have contributed to California\&#x27;s rich agriculture. \n\nA portrait of Dolores Huerta, a political leader and another leader of the United Farm Workers Union, is included too. In her hand, she holds a pair of wire cutters, a tool she uses to open a fence and allow more children access to freedom and education. She is also shown handing a scroll to a student with the popular phrase “Si Se Puede” or \&quot;Yes You Can\&quot; written across it. The scroll winds between the children and into the hand of Chavez, where a quote from him has been written: “Help me take responsibility for my own life so I can be free at last.\&quot;\n\nThis mural was created in collaboration with Juana Alicia, Elba Rivera, Margo Bors and Gabriela Lujan. It measures 38 by 180 feet, and was funded by SF Mayors’ Office of Community Development, WESTAF, and the Zellerbach Family Fund.\n\nAfter the mural suffered water damage, Precita Eyes restored it in 2014 with funding from the San Francisco School District and the Capitol Improvement Fund. \n",

        description: "In 2003 the Alemany Market partnered with Precita Eyes to paint a mural on every stall and archway in its concrete outdoor structure. After a year of planning and three months of painting, all 80 stalls (including 16 archways) were covered by 4,000 square feet of acrylic on stucco. \n\nTwenty artists and dozens of volunteers worked on the designs, and all were encouraged to visit their assigned stalls before starting their designs. By incorporating the local farmers selling at the different stalls in the mural designs, the entire series accomplished its goal of recognizing farmers\&#x27; contributions to the community. \n\n\&quot;The Eggman family, for example, has been selling honey at the market for almost fifty years. Pointing to the mural painted on their stall, number thirty-one, a young man working at the stand explained, \&#x27;It’s of our great uncle and aunt who were the first to start coming to the market.\&#x27; He pauses, then adds, \&#x27;The murals have added so much.\&#x27;\&quot;",

Instructors Carol Nunnelly and Martha Wade led a group of five students: Jae Chan Lee, Amanda Plummer, Layla Skramstad, Katrina Valdez and Michael Wiens. \n\nThe paint was paid for by the Bristol Hotel and the mural spans 30 feet long by 13 feet tall along the Bristol Hotel’s exterior stucco wall.\n\nFun Fact!

        description: "According to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle in 2002, the idea for \&quot;Cupid\&#x27;s Span\&quot; originated when Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen were working on another commissioned art project for the National Gallery in London. \n\nThat piece of art was responding to a famous work in its collection, \&quot;The Music Lesson\&quot; by Johannes Vermeer. Van Bruggen noticed the painting of Cupid with his archer\&#x27;s bow in the background of Vermeer\&#x27;s picture.\n\nThe artists said they were \&quot;inspired by San Francisco’s reputation as the home port of Eros,\&quot; a city of love.\n\n\&quot;We began our project for a small park on the Embarcadero along San Francisco Bay by trying out the subject of Cupid’s stereotypical bow and arrow. The first sketches were made of the subject with the bowstring drawn back, poised on the feathers of the arrow, which pointed up to the sky.” \n\nFun Fact! It’s 60 feet tall, 140 feet long, and buries the point of the arrow purposefully to keep from being violent.",

        description: "This monument is dedicated to the Norwegian polar explorer who was the first to locate the magnetic North Pole and navigate the Northwest Passage, the Arctic water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific. \n\nThe stone comprising the monument is a ‘bauta,’ a stone shaft of Norwegian granite, and was donated by Bay Area Norwegians on March 1, 1930. \n\nThe inscription reads, \n\n“He left Norway with a crew of six on June 16 of 1903 in a 69-foot long converted herring boat named Gjoa. Amundsen spent three years on the perilous journey. The Gjoa continued on, sailing through the Bering Straits and anchored off Point Bonita, outside the Golden Gate on October 19, 1906. \n\nThe San Francisco Norwegian community purchased the Gjoa from Amundsen and donated the ship to the people of San Francisco in 1909. In 1911, Amundsen became the first explorer to reach the South Pole. The Gjoa remained at this site at the west end of Golden Gate Park until 1972, when it was returned to Norway. The restored ship is now on display at the Maritime Museum in Oslo.”",

        description: "This mural was commissioned as a celebration of keeping the earth clean in the Internet age. It features an environmentally-themed poem by local poet Alvaro Guttierez. “Waves of Wisdom” is a fine addition to the Mission number one cultural attraction – it’s ever growing, outdoor scattered site museum of mega-paintings.\n\nArriba Juntos means “upwards together” and the Center’s mission is to meet the basic needs of Latino immigrants in the Mission District.\n \nInscription:\n“We’re blessed to have a mother who comforts our souls with summer breezes, cleansing our bodies with every drop of her sows.\nRespect her kindness, her love, and her nature. Never throw oil into the storm drain and always recycle… don’t allow the sacrifices made for the future and offered by Earth to have been in vain.”\n \nFun Fact! All in all, this mural covers 2,100 square feet.",

        description: "From the artists:\n\nHistorically “The Language of the Birds” was considered a divine language birds used to communicate with the initiated. Here, a flock of books takes off from the plaza to fly the urban gullies of the city. The fluttering books have left a gentle imprint of words beneath them. These serendipitously configured bits of local literature reveal the layering of culture, nature and consciousness.\n\nLanguage of the Birds is a flock of twenty-three sculpted illuminated books, which appear to have just taken flight from the plaza like pigeons scared up by a passer by. Appearing to be in motion, the books have flown open creating various wing positions with the pages and bindings. The entire artwork appears to be in motion with each book holding its position as a bird does in a flock.\n\nEach unique book is fabricated in frosted white translucent polycarbonate. These sculptural elements are suspended from a geometric web of stainless steel aircraft cables. At night LED lights embedded in the books create visual patterns, at different times one might see the flock subtly pulsing or displaying a spectacular zoetropic effect. The dynamic lights of Language of the Birds play in the night sky with the other luminous signs of the area.\n\nPassing under the flock, pedestrians notice words and phrases embedded in the plaza floor that appear to have fallen from the pages. On closer inspection the fallen words are in English, Italian and Chinese and were selected from the neighborhood’s rich literary history, ranging from the Beats, to SF Renaissance poets and Chinese writers, over 90 authors are represented including Armistead Maupin, Gary Snyder,William T. Vollman, and Jade Snow Wong.\n\nThe artists created the design of the plaza floor in Atrium of the SFMOMA. Retaining their original font, individual words from chosen phrases were cast from the third floor gallery of the museum. Words fluttered down 60 feet landing on a paper replica of the plaza thus determining their resting place in the final artwork. Influenced by practices like reading tea-leaves and Japanese gardening techniques. The words intersect in ways that allow for new unique interpretations and meanings.\n\nGoggin conceptualized of the piece during a residency at the Djerassi foundation. “I sat with my understanding of the site, while watching swallows move through the air, they came together to create fleeting compositions. The image of flying books emerged from the idea of culture and nature interconnecting in unexpected ways.” Influenced by the literary genre magic realism, his sculptures bring new life, movement and meaning to familiar objects.\n\nHistorically “the language of the birds” is referred to in mythology, medieval literature, and occult texts as a mystical, ideal or divine language, or a mythical or magical language used by birds to communicate with the initiated. In Kaballah, Renaissance magic, and alchemy, the language of the birds was considered a secret key to perfect knowledge.\n\nGoggin and Keehn teamed up with scientist David Shearer and Lawrence Ferlengetti’s City lights bookstore to power Language of the Birds with solar panels mounted on top of the iconic bookstore. It is the first permanent solar-powered public art piece in the United States.",

A special thanks  to Laurie Siegel for firing so many of the mosaic tiles &amp; designing the classroom syllabus.  \n\nMore than one thousand children in area schools sculpted and signed the three-inch names tiles that form the body of the tree. The leaves of the tree are mirror. The higher leaf groupings reflect the movement of the sky, the lower mirror the garden, street, and people walking by. Sponsorship tiles form the background surrounding the tree, reflecting thoughts of the community.   \n\nThe Yume Tree was installed and dedicated in October, 2003, and new Tiles are added every six months or so.  It\&#x27;s never too late to add your voice to this growing neighborhood mosaic.  ",

        description: "“Shooting For the Stars…not each other” is a remarkable 30 foot by 30 foot mosaic mural designed and installed by native DC muralist Cheryl Foster, who was commissioned by the DCCAH in 2000.  The mural, made up of tile, glass beads, and mirror embellishments, depicts three young people from the Washington Highlands neighborhood who are “soaring through the sky in search of boundless opportunities,” according to Foster. The project included the neighborhood youth, who assisted the artist a great deal in creating the mural. “Shooting for the Stars” was a response to the community’s expressed wishes to display an uplifting and exuberant message for the area’s youth, and the result was precisely that.",

        description: " In 2009, the DCCAH partnered with the D.C.’s Summer Youth Employment Program and Albus Cavus, a nonprofit artist collective and mentoring program, to create one of the largest murals in D.C. The mural, which spans 275 feet on the Rhode Island Avenue Shopping Center building, is titled “From Edgewood to the Edge of the World.” Public response has been positive.  According to a Washington Post article, District artist Quest Skinner remarked that “people now stop in this area where typically they cut through. It changes your environment. Your environment can be luscious even in the darkest of times in the darkest of places.\&quot; The goal of the mural, says Albus Cavus director Peter Krsko, is to inspire people to “step beyond their own personal boundaries.” ",

The artwork consists of two components. The 130-foot-long stylized painted mural by Andrew Reid illustrates the rich history of the Georgia Avenue-Petworth community. The bold design of the contoured mural is a flowing chronology of defining events in the George Avenue-Petworth community in the context of local and world histories. The high energy of the handmade clay and cracked tiles of the accompanying frieze by Carlos Alves captures the spirit and promise of the Georgia Avenue-Petworth community.\&quot; More: http://www.wmata.com/community_outreach/metroarts/artwork/red/mc_ribbons_1.cfm",

        description: "From the Gallery\&#x27;s Facebook page: \n\nThe Smithsonian Institution has two museums of Asian art: the Freer Gallery of Art which opened to the public in 1923, and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, which welcomed its first visitors in 1987. \n\nBoth are physically connected by an underground passageway, and ideologically linked through the study, exhibition, and sheer love of Asian art. Collections feature ancient to contemporary masterpieces and exhibitions of works from Japan, China, Korea, Southeast Asia, India, and the Near East.\n\nIn addition, the Freer Gallery contains an important collection of 19th century American art punctuated by James McNeill Whistler\&#x27;s Peacock Room, perhaps one of the earliest (and certainly one of the most controversial) art installations on record. \n\nCitation: https://www.facebook.com/FreerSackler?sk=info",

        description: "This sculpted bandshell flaked by colonnades is the focal point of the Music Concourse. Completed in the Italian Renaissance style, it has hosted numerous performers over the years -- everyone from opera singer Luciano Pavarotti to the Grateful Dead. The Golden Gate Park Band has played 25 free concerts here every year on Sundays since the bandshell was built. \n\nIt was dedicated on September 9, 1900, but it suffered serious damaged during the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes and has repeatedly undergone extensive restorations. It was designed to serve an audience of 20,000 and placed low in the ground to protect listeners from the wind.\n\nThe Spreckels Temple of Music was designed by the Reid Brothers architects, and the relief sculptures were completed by Robert Aitken. The female nude on the left holds a U-shaped harp called a lyre and the one on the right has a trumpet. \n\nThe building is named in honor of industrialist Claus Spreckels (of the Spreckels Sugar Company) who gave $75,000 towards the $78,810 it cost to build.

        description: "This vase is a colossal wine pitcher covered in figures associated with the Roman god of wine, Bacchus. These include cupids, satyrs, bacchantes, Silenus (Bacchus’s drunken attendant) and Diana (goddess of the hunt, associated with woodlands and wild animals) who together protect the grapes from pests like a giant spider, snakes, a rat and insects. The title is French for \&quot;poem of the vine.\&quot;\n\nThe sculpture was commissioned by French winemakers who exhibited it at the 1878 Paris World’s Fair. This bronze version was cast in 1882 and shipped to Chicago for the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893. After that it travelled here to San Francisco for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition where Michael H. de Young purchased it and later donated it to the de Young Museum. ",

In biology, once a single spore is released it has the potential to develop into a new organism, and similarly the Spore artwork promotes a shift in the way we perceive our everyday environments. ---- March 20 - April 27 ---- The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities\&#x27; 5x5 project will exhibit 25 ground-breaking public art installations commissioned by artists from around the world.",

        description: "The H Street Bridge is a significant bridge in the D.C. area, spanning the central railway lines behind Union Station.  However, there is great cultural significance to the bridge as well, as it connects the economically depressed northeast corridor of the city to the beautiful Smithsonian Mall and Capitol grounds.  Once described as a “public eyesore” that was “bare and forbidding” and discouraged foot traffic, the Hopscotch Bridge project was proposed to encourage the interaction between communities. Hopscotch Bridge partnered with local artist Deirdre Saunder, Capitol Hill Arts Workshop, and a mural organization called DC ART/WORKS that employs city youth in order to create 320 colorful “hopscotch” mosaics which seem to dance across the bridge walls.  Completed in 2007, the figures were modeled on the hopscotch game, with varying colors, shapes, and textures.  They were constructed and installed with the help of inner-city high school students.  The project thus not only transformed the H Street Bridge into a source of public pride that beckons visitors to cross the bridge, but also included DC youth in a positive and educational experience.

These included the Maguire Act of 1895 which abolished imprisonment for deserting a vessel, and the White Act of 1898, which ended corporal punishment.\n\nHarry Lundeberg was elected as the first president of the Sailor\&#x27;s Union of the Pacific, after helping successfully lead the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike. His bust was completed by E. Hunt, and on front of it is inscribed, \&quot;He was indeed a man who crowded into a short life no glittering promise, but unselfish service and general achievement for the course he called his own.\&quot;\n\nAndrew Furuseth helped form the Sailors\&#x27; Union of the Pacific and the International Seamen\&#x27;s Union. His bust was created by Hal Bayard Runyon, and inscribed on it is the \&#x27;Furuseth Credo\&#x27;: \&quot;You can put me in jail. But you cannot give me narrower quarters than as a seaman I have always had. You cannot give me coarser food than I have always eaten. You cannot make me lonelier than I have always been.\&quot;",

Created by an Iraqi-born artist of Assyrian descent, it was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts and presented to the City of San Francisco in 1988 as a gift from the Assyrian people. \n\nKing Ashurbanipal (669-627 BCE) established the Library of Ashurbanipal, a collection of cuneiform documents that became the first systematically organized library in the ancient Middle East. Part of it survives today at the British Museum and at his palace in Nineveh, Iraq.\n\nIn the Bible Ashurbanipal is referred to as Asenappar (Ezra 4:10), and the Roman historian Justinus called him Sardanapalus.\n\nThe dedication reads:\n\nPeace unto heaven and earth\nPeace unto countries and cities\nPeace unto the dwellers in all lands",

        description: "This monument was a gift to the city from philanthropist James Lick, who left $100,000 for the creation of \&quot;statutory emblematic of the significant epochs in California history,\&quot; dating back to the missions\&#x27; early settlement. The monument came under fire in the \&#x27;90s for its offensive portrayal of Native Americans. The figure grouping at the back shows a missionary and a settler standing over the only representation of Native peoples: a man who is on the ground looking up to his European oppressors. \n	\nThe monument\&#x27;s center column is topped with a woman, Eureka, who represents California, holding a shield and spear and accompanied by the California bear. On the column below her there are four bronze reliefs depicting four important events in California\&#x27;s founding: \&quot;Crossing the Sierra,\&quot; \&quot;Vaqueros Lassoing a Bull,\&quot; \&quot;Trapper Trading Skins with Indians,\&quot; and \&quot;California\&#x27;s Progress under American Rule.\&quot; \n\nTwo dates appear on the column: 1848, marking the discovery of gold and 1850, the year California joined the United States. Around the bottom of the column are five portrait medallions of men in California\&#x27;s history: John Sutter, John Fremont, Sir Francis Drake, Father Juniper Serra, and James Lick (the monument\&#x27;s commissioner). Below these portraits are the names: Vallejo, Larkin, Marshall, Castro, Stockton, Sloat, Portola, and Cabrillo, the Bay Area\&#x27;s first successful families.\n\nThe women on either side of Eureka are allegorical figures. The woman rowing in a boar represents Commerce, and Plenty is shown seated with a cornucopia representing abundance. The other two sculptural groups each contain three figures and represent California\&#x27;s founding. The one in front of Eureka is titled \&quot;In \&#x27;49\&quot; and shows three gold miners. The group behind her is titled \&quot;Early Days\&quot; and features a missionary, a Native American, and a Vaquero. \n\nOriginally this monument stood in Marshall Square in front of the old City Hall that was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. When the city was rebuilt, Grove and Hyde Streets were extended to meet Market Street and the Pioneer Monument stood at that intersection until it was moved to its present location in 1993. ",

After a careful conservation period, they were installed outside the entrances in 2013. Both are nearly five feet tall and six feet long. \n\nPlacing pairs of guardian figures outside important buildings has a long history in many East Asian cultures. This pair is Japanese, and unlike Chinese guardians which typically face away from each other, the Japanese foo dogs are usually found facing one other. Since the Heian period (794-1185) the pairs included an open-mouthed lion and an imaginary, close-mouthed \&quot;lion dog\&quot; distinguished by having one horn. \n\nThe lion guards the Asian Art Museum from physical danger, and the lion-dog protects against the spiritual world\&#x27;s unseen threats.\n\n\&quot;We certainly hope they\&#x27;ll capture people\&#x27;s imagination and become iconic and beloved symbols of the museum,\&quot; the AAM\&#x27;s curator of Japanese art, Laura Allen told SF Weekly. \&quot;At the same time, we might change them from time to time with other sculpture, and then bring them back again.\&quot;\n\nThese sculptures somehow avoided the Japanese government\&#x27;s mandatory metal collections before World War II. They were been donated to the museum by Marsha Vargas Handley in memory of her husband, Raymond G. Handley.",

The project, commissioned by the DCCAH and designed by artist Jerome Meadows in 2006, is comprised of four carved limestone figures.  Two depict a mother and a father supporting a child on their shoulders, and the other two depict community caretakers embellished with photo-etched plates of prominent community leaders. All the figures have mosaic tile insets and glazed ceramic faces by David Driskell.  In addition, there are 21 custom made ceramic tile units set into colored concrete walkway. Located in the 16th Street Heights neighborhood,   this work truly highlights the interwoven lives of this supportive and tight knit community. ",

        description: "“Tuloy po Kayo” is Filipino for “welcome” and the mural depicts the history of the Filipino people. In the center, a balangay (boat) and araw (sun) represent the significance of the Filipino peoples’ ancient sea-faring and their overseas immigration to the US. The poles of the balangay form a star-shape and when viewed with the two star-shaped parol lanterns at each end of the mural, the stars and sun evoke the Filipino flag. The parol lanterns themselves are important symbols of light and blessings, evoking holiday traditions widely celebrated among Filipinos: here in SOMA, the annual Parol Festival brings thousands to Jessie Square each December. As a nod to ancient literacy and the importance of education, the mural’s bottom edge contains the baybayin alphabet, a pre-colonial written language of early indigenous Filipinos – a western translation is also included.\n\nThis mural was painted with the help of artists Miguel Bounce Perez, Thavin Rajanakhan, Oree Originol, James Ganyan Garcia, and Robert Trujillo. It was sponsored by Kularts, Inc., the Galing Bata bi-lingual school program, and the Filipino Education Center/Bessie Carmichael School with funding from the Yerba Buena Community Benefit District.",

        description: "Epoch, an impressive and vibrant sculpture, seems to burst with energy on the corner outside the PEPCO headquarters.  The monumental, abstract sculpture stands 25 feet high and was created by nationally renowned sculptor Albert Paley, who was commissioned by the DCCAH in 2004.  PEPCO, which has a long history of supporting the arts, was an ideal place to install this work of art.  As John Derrick, chairman of PEPCO, stated: “The area really is experiencing a spectacular renaissance and we are proud to be a part of it.” Edison Place, which is home to PEPCO, also has an important historical background: it was the first major office building in D.C. to be designed by a minority-owned architectural firm.  Epoch thus represents the ever-evolving dynamic of the District. The sculpture also features poetry by Dolores Kendrick, the second African-American woman to have her poetry featured in a public art project.",

        description: "In this sculpture an oversized mustachioed nude is operating a cider press. A child kneels at his feet, and branches and apples surround the base, along with a bucket and pitcher. Originally the statue was a water fountain that had a cup attached with a chain -- rumor says it used cider instead of water.\n\nThis sculpture was originally exhibited at the Midwinter International Exposition in 1894. There it was purchased from the French Commission for the Music Concourse by the fair\&#x27;s director, Michael H. de Young. \n\nArt and Architecture\&#x27;s Cindy Casey pointed out that the figure \&quot;bears some resemblance to Douglas Tilden’s Mechanics Monument located on Market street in that it bears tribute to the value of hard work.\&quot; \n\n",

It was dedicated on November 17, 1907.\n\nThe sculpture was cast in bronze by the American Bronze Company, and Raymond Granite Company constructed the hidden rectangular base beneath the figure of the friar. The $10,000 it took to make was funded by James D. Phelan.\n\nFun Fact! Standing on a nine-foot base, in total the sculpture is 21 feet tall.",

One of these excerpts was from an original poem called “We Embrace” by E. Ethelbert Miller, chair of the Humanities Council of Washington, DC. Her poem reads the following: “We fought against the invisible/ We looked to one another for comfort/ We held the hands of friends and lovers/We did not turn our backs/We embrace/ We embrace.” Ward One Councilmember Jim Graham initiated this project, and it was one of the first public art projects which focused on poetry as art.",

        description: "These two Byzantine-style mosaic murals by Helen Bruton and F. Alston Swift were installed in 1936, two years after the Art Gallery opened. They are located on the eastern facade, flanking the building\&#x27;s double entrance. Each mural measures 18\&#x27; by 10\&#x27;.\n\n\&quot;The left (Swift) panel is said to allegorically depict music and painting. There is a woman with a violin, and a woman with an easel. The right (Bruton) panel is said to depict Sculpture and Dance (a man seated behind a partially carved stone block, and three woman dancers).\&quot;\n\nLearn more:  http://www.wpamurals.com/berkel2.htm",
